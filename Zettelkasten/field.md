To be a *field*, a [[set]] $\displaystyle \large F$ must satisfy several [[axioms]], notably:

1. **Additive identity**: There is a $\displaystyle \large 0 \in F$ such that $\displaystyle \large a+0 = a, \forall a \in F$  

2. **Multiplicative identity**: There is a $\displaystyle \large 1 \in F$ such that $\displaystyle \large a \cdot 1 = a, \forall a \in F$  

3. **Additive inverses**: For every $\displaystyle \large a \in F$, there is an element $\displaystyle \large -a$ such that $\displaystyle \large a + (-a) = 0$

4. **Multiplicative inverses**: For every nonzero $\displaystyle \large a \in F$, there is an element $\displaystyle \large a^{-1} \in F$ such that $\displaystyle \large a \cdot a^{-1}=1$
