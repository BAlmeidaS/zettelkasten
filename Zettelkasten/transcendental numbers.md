A **transcendental number** is a number that is *not the root of any [[polynomial]] equation **with integer coefficients***.

*Integer coefficients is the key here*.

Two most famous transcendental numbers are $\displaystyle \large \pi$ and $\displaystyle \large e$.

Getting $\displaystyle \large \pi$ as an example, there is no [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients,
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1x+a_0 = 0,
\end{eqnarray}$$
*such that, $\displaystyle \large \pi$ is the solution!*

To clarify even more, get $\displaystyle \large \sqrt{2}$, it is an [[irrational numbers]] but it is *not a transcendental number*, why? Because, for instance, the following polynomial,
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
x^2-2 = 0,
\end{eqnarray}$$
has as solution $\displaystyle \large \sqrt{2}$.
