*significance requires 2 or more standard errors*

This is a *rule of thumb* that disregarding very small sample sizes, if you aim for t-student of 2 standard deviations from the mean, you gonna fall on the 95% of the distribution, or 95% of [[Confidence Interval]] - similar with [[Gaussian - 95% and 1.96 standard deviations]]

This graph show the number of standard deviations to get 95% of the distribution for many samples sizes on student's t distribution:
