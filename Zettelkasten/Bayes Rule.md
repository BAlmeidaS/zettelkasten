$$\Huge P(b \mid a) = \dfrac{P(a \mid b)*P(b)}{P(a)}$$

To remember this formula easier remember that $\large P(b \mid a)$ is $\large P(b)$ times a new information (a posterior - [[Posterior probabilities]]) which is connected with the probability of $\large a$ happens given $\large b$ (normalised).
