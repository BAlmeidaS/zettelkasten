*Interval variables* are [[Numerical variables]] where both the order and the exact differences between the values are meaningful. However, *they do not have a true zero point*. Thus, you can interpret only the difference between intervals, but not in the whole set.

This means while you can meaningfully add or subtract values (to measure differences), you cannot meaningfully multiply or divide them because the zero point is arbitrary and does not indicate "none" or "absence" of the quantity.

>[!example]
>**Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit** is a classic example, where 0Â°C does not mean the absence of temperature, thus making statements like "twice as hot" ambiguous without further context.
>Another one will be *calendar year*, since the year 0 is not the year 0. Therefore you cannot say that the year 2000 is "twice as late" as the year 1000.
