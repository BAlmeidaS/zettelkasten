The basic idea of the fuzzy set theory is that an element belongs to a fuzzy set with a certain *degree of membership*, that varies from 0 to 1. Not only 0 or 1.

Classical set theory:
$$\displaystyle \large f_a(x):X \rightarrow \{0,1\}$$
Fuzzy theory - being $\displaystyle \large \mu$ the [[membership function]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \mu_a(x):X\rightarrow[0,1]$$
