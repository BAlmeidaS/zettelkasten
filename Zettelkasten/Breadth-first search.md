An [[Uninformed Search]] algorithm

It expands the search layer by layer. It expands the search contours as the perimeter of a circle.

Can be implemented with an [[Early Goal Test]]

| Criterion | BFS |
| --------- | --- |
| [[Completeness]]? | Yes |
| [[Cost optimality]]? | Yes |
| [[Time complexity]] | $\Large O(b^d)$ |
| [[Space complexity]] | $\Large O(b^d)$ |
