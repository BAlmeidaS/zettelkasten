The most common assumptions about the [[Response variable]] to run [[Regression Analysis|Linear Model]] and its variants ([[Analyse of Variance|Anova]] and [[Analysis of Covariance|ANCOVA]]) are:
1. [[Randomisation|random sampling]]
2. Constant Variance
3. Normal errors (remember of [[Model Checking - Linear Model]])
4. [[independence of errors]]
5. Additive effects
