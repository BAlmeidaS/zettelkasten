*Stratified random sampling* is a method of sampling that involves *dividing the population into distinct subgroups or strata that share similar characteristics*, and then selecting a random sample from each of these *strata* (plural of stratum).

The key objective of this approach is to ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the final sample. So *the proportion of each one in the sample follows the same proportion in the original population*.
