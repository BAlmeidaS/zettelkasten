[[Bayesian Network|Bayes Net]] gives a way more compact structure than its cousin [[Full Joint Probability Distribution]]

If we have 30 boolean variables with a $\displaystyle \large k$ of 5 (highest amount of parents of a node / branching factor).

The bayes net requires $\displaystyle \huge 2^k*n=960$
Whilst the full joint distribution is $\displaystyle \huge 2^{30} \approx 10^9$
