They conduct a multivariate regression on the metadata of datasets and performance of multiple GNN models and examine the correlation between GNN performance and data properties.

They show that Gini-Degree, Edge Homogeneity, and In-feature similarity are salient features for all of the models they consider and that average degree, pseudo-diameter, and feature angular snr are salient for some of the models.

They also perform some analysis on how the gini-coefficient of the degree distribution affects model performances on a novel SBM.

Overall, I think this is a novel approach to an important problem and a good paper.
