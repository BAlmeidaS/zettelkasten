The paper titled "TransMOT: Spatial-Temporal Graph Transformer for Multiple Object Tracking" introduces a novel approach named TransMOT for tracking multiple objects in videos by modeling spatial-temporal interactions among objects using graph transformers. This method arranges object trajectories as sparse weighted graphs and utilizes a spatial graph transformer encoder layer, a temporal transformer encoder layer, and a spatial graph transformer decoder layer to effectively and efficiently capture these interactions. Additionally, a cascade association framework is proposed to handle low-score detections and long-term occlusions, further enhancing the tracking speed and accuracy. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets such as MOT15, MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20, TransMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional transformer-based methods.
