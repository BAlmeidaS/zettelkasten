This paper considers a novelty proposed problem of matrix sensing over graphs (MSoG), which is a general case of matrix completion and matrix sensing problems. It proposes a novel variant of RIP condition named Ω-RIP condition and analyse the optimisation landscape of MSoG problem. With an improved regularise of the incoherence, it proves that the strict saddle property holds for the MSoG problem with high probability under the incoherence condition and the Ω-RIP condition.
