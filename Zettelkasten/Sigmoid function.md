*Sigmoid function* has the famous S-shape and it is commonly used in [[classification]] problems.

A sigmoid, $\displaystyle \large \sigma(x)$, can be defined with any one of the following:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma(x) &=& \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \\ \\
\sigma(x) &=& \dfrac{e^x}{1+e^{x}} \\ \\
\sigma(x) &=& 1 - \sigma(-x) \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
