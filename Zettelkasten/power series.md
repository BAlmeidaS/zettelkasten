The power series are *NOT* [[polynomial]] mainly because they are infinite. They are a *infinite series* of the form:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\sum^\infty_{n=0}a_n(x-c)^n
\end{eqnarray}$$

The [[sum of geometric series|geometric series]] ($\displaystyle \large 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots$) is a power series, the sum is equal to $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{1}{1-x}$
