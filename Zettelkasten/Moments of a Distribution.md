In statistics, the *moments of a distribution* are quantitative measures related to the shape of the distribution's graph.

Each successive moment corresponds to a higher level of detail about the distribution's shape.

- 1st Moment - [[Average|Mean]]
- 2nd Moment - [[Variance]]
- 3rd Moment - [[Skewness]]
- 4th Moment - [[Kurtosis]]
- 5th and so on - Higher order Moments

In practice, over 3rd moment is already *Higher order Moments*. However, it is after the 5th that they became tough to interpret and, therefore, will not be analysed.
