This paper proposes MPNN-then-SF, a novel link prediction model that combines neural common neighbor (NCN) with structural feature (SF) guidance. Additionally, the impact of graph incompleteness is investigated, leading to the introduction of Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC), which outperforms recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results in link prediction benchmarks. Generally, I think this paper is interesting: the proposed MPNN-then-SF and NCNC models both look novel to me. Regarding the only one (of three) negative review, I think the authors' rebuttal comments have well addressed the reviewer's concerns. In sum, I would like to recommend accepting this paper.
