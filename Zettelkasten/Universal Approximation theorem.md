The theorem that rules [[Neural networks]].

The corresponding theorem that formulates this basic idea of approximation is called [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem). It is a fundamental result in the field of ANN, which states that certain types of neural network can approximate certain function to any desired degree of accuracy. This theorem suggest that a neural network is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data as long as certain conditions are fulfilled.

The Universal Approximation Theorem is the _root-cause_ why ANN are so successful and capable in solving a wide range of problems in machine learning and other fields.
