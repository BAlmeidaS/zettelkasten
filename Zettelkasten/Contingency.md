In [[Statistics]], *contigencies* means *all the events that could possibly happen*.

A contingency table is when you have the count for each possible combination of events:

|           | Blue eyes | Brown eyes |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Fair Hair | 38        | 11         |
| Dark Hair | 14        | 51         |

These are observable frequencies
