p-value are calculated on the assumption that the [[Null Hypothesis]] is true. It has to do with the plausibility of the [[Null Hypothesis]].

The *p-value* is a numerical value that quantifies how likely it is to observe that data (or a more extreme outcome), assuming that the [[Null Hypothesis]] is true.

"It tells you the probability of getting that result by chance".

"Lower than a threshold we must reject the null hypothesis"

It shows the size of the [[Test Statistic]] and if we will *reject* or *fail to reject* the [[Null Hypothesis]]

*Remember that we want to reject h0 when p-value is less than .05, or 0.04999, so 0.51 is not less so we cannot reject h0*
