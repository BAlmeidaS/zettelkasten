A *basis* is a set of [[vector|vectors]] that are [[linear independent|inearly independent]], that spam the whole space $\displaystyle \large S$

In order words, any vector $\displaystyle \large v$, being $\displaystyle \large v \in S$, can be written as a composition of the vectors of a *basis* of $\displaystyle \large S$.
