Combination of [[Graph Transformer Networks]] with [[BERT]] in order to leverage the prediction of EHR (eletronic health records) predictions. This is a paper using GT to solve some type of *Temporal Graph Application*.

The openreview adds 3 papers, that are older but apparently do similar job
[1] Hypergraph Transformers for EHR-based Clinical Predictions
[2] EHRSHOT: An EHR Benchmark for Few-Shot Evaluation of Foundation Models
[3] Unsupervised pre-training of graph transformers on patient population graphs
