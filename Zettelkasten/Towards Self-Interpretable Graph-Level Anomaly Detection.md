This paper studies graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD), which aims to find the anomalous graphs. To construct an explainable GLAD under an unsupervised manner, the authors first proposed a multi-view subgraph information bottleneck (MSIB) framework and then introduce a dual hypergraph as a supplemental view of the original graph. The core contribution of the paper is the designing of a self-explainable GLAD model.
