*Ensemble methods* are techniques in machine learning that combine multiple individual models, typically *weak learners, to create a stronger and more robust model*.

By aggregating the predictions of several weak learners, the ensemble can achieve better performance, often in terms of accuracy and generalisation, than any single model alone.
