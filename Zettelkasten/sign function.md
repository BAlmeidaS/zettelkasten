$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
sign(x) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \ge 0 \\
0 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
-1 & \text{if } x \lt 0
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}$$

The name *sign* is good because it *keeps the sign of the input*! Thus, sometimes is defined as $\displaystyle \large 1$ when $\displaystyle \large x=0$.

Similar to the [[step function]] but keeping the sign.
