aka **Element of a chromosome**

Most authors don't make any distinguish between [[Gene]] and [[Chromosomes]]. Having said that, *Negnevistky* defines as gene the *smallest* (indivisible) part of the chromosome. The changes that GA will make on the chromosome will be always on the chromosome level (not in the *gene* level), which means that only the *genes* will be changed.

A gene can be a **number**, but can also be a **list**, or **any other structure**. Again, when we apply mutation in a gene that *is a list* (let's say), the whole list must be changed for a new one, not the individual items inside.
