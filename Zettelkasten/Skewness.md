It measures which a distribution has [[Long Tail distributions|long tails]] on one side. The degree of skew of a distribution $\displaystyle \large \gamma_1$

[[Normal Distribution]] has $\displaystyle \large skew = 0$.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
skew &=& \gamma_1 = \dfrac{m_3}{s_3} \\ \\
m_3 &=& \dfrac{\sum(y-\bar{y})^3}{n} \\
s_3 &=& sd(y)^3 = \left(\sqrt{s^2}\right)^3 \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

The standard error of skew is, defined as,
$$\displaystyle \Huge SE_{y_1} = \sqrt{\dfrac{6}{n}}$$

*Negatives values of $\displaystyle \large \gamma_1$* means skew to the *left* - (tail is on the left).
*Positives values of $\displaystyle \large \gamma_1$* means skew to the *right* - (tail is on the right).
