A problem with less restrictions on the axis is called a relaxed problem. The state-space of it is a supergraph of the original state-space.

Any *optimal solution in the original problem*, is, also just a *solution in the relaxed problem*.

The cost of an optimal solution to a relaxed problem is an [[Admissible Heuristic]] for the original problem.
