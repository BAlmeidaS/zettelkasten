After choosing the ones that will be used on the next generation, there is a chance - *percentage of Crossover*. That 2 of them are chosen to crossover.

Usually this **chance is between 0.6 and 0.9**

Crossover will get a part of the chromosome of one parent and mix with another part from the second parent to create the *first offspring*. The rest of the first with the rest of the second will be used to create the *second offspring*.

So there will be neither the parent 1 or 2 that will pass to next generation, but their mix, offspring 1 and 2.

Strategies that are often used:
- [[One-point crossover]]
- [[Two-point crossover]]
- [[Uniform crossover]]
- [[Partially Matched Crossover - PMX]]
