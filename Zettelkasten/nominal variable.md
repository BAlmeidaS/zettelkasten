A *nominal variable* is a [[Categorical variable]] where the categories **do not have a natural order or ranking**.

The categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning each observation belongs to one and only one category, and all possible categories are considered.

The categories are distinct with no inherent hierarchy or sequence.

>Blood type: $\displaystyle \large {A, B, O, AB}$
