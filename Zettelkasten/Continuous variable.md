*Continuous variables* can take on any value within a range, including fractions and irrational numbers, much like the real numbers $\displaystyle \large \mathbb{R}$.

This characteristic allows continuous variables to represent measurements that can be infinitely precise, analogous to how real numbers can represent points on a continuous number line.
