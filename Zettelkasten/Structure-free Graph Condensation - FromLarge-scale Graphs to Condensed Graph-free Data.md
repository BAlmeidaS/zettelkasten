This paper studies the problem of reducing the size of a large graph dataset while preserving task-relevant information. It introduces a new methodology to distill large-scale real-world graphs into smaller synthetic graph node sets by disregarding graph structures to create condensed graph-free data. The approach involves two key components: a training trajectory meta-matching scheme for effectively synthesizing small-scale graph-free data, and a graph neural feature score metric for evaluating the quality of condensed graph-free data dynamically. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
