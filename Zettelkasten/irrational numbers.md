*irrational numbers* are numbers that cannot be expressed as *the ratio of two [[integers]]**:

$\displaystyle \large 2.1$ is *rational* because it can be expressed as $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{21}{10}$. However, $\displaystyle \large \sqrt{2}$ is *irrational* because there is no fraction that express the same number.
