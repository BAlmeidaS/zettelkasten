*Performance* is a [[non-functional requirements|non-functional requirement]]

It is associated with two concepts:
- *time* required to process something
- *rate* at which something is processed

Time and Rate are too broad.

Instead of *Time* we say [[Latency]]
Instead of *Rate* we say [[Throughput]]
