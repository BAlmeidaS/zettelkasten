Algorithms inspired on Darwin evolution. The idea is that a [[Population - genetic algorithms|population]] formed by [[Chromosomes]] evolves across [[Generation - Genetic Algorithms|generations]].

To define a GA you must define:
1. [[Encoding - Genetic Algorithms|Encoding]]
2. [[Fitness Function - Genetic Algorithm|Fitness Function]]
3. [[Genetic Operators]] 

Besides that 4 [[Hyperparameters of the model|Hyperparameters]] must be defined:
- [[Population - genetic algorithms|Population]] size
- Number of [[Generation - Genetic Algorithms|generations]]
- [[Crossover]] rate
- [[Mutation]] rate

Many Authors call GA (*Genetic Algorithms*) as [[Evolutionary Strategies]] and [[Genetic Programming]]. So we can understand GAs as the main branch.
