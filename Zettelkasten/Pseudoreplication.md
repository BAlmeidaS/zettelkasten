When you have analyse the data as if you had more [[degrees of freedom]] than you really have, either because:

- Temporal *pseudoreplication* involving repeated measurements from the same individual
- Spatial *pseudoreplication* several measurements from the same "area" / issues with [[Randomisation]].

It is a problem because of [[independence of errors]]
