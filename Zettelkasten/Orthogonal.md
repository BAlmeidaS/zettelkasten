Two [[vector]] are orthogonal (in respect of some [[inner product]]) following this definition:

We say that two [[vector|vectors]] are **orthogonal** if the [[cosine]] of their [[angle between vectors|angle]] is 0. In other words, their [[inner product]] is zero.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\text{$x$ and $y$ are orthogonal} \iff \langle x,y \rangle = 0
\end{eqnarray}$$

So, *orthogonality* is defined based on an specific [[inner product]]. Different *inner products* might define vectors as orthogonal or not.

*with an [[Similarity function|similarity]] approach*, we say that *orthogonal vectors are the most dissimilar*, having only the origin as similarity.
