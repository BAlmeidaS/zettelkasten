A factorial experiment has *two or more factors* ([[Categorical variable]] as [[Explanatory variable|independent variable]]) each *with two or more **levels*** (# of categories).

We can investigate statistical interaction in which the *response to one factor depends on the level of another factor*. Also, we must understand the interaction among the [[Explanatory variable|independent variable]], if there is any, we must remove one of them.
