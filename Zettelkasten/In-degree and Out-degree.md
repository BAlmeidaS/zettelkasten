In [[Directed Graphs]] the [[Node Degree]] is measured of amount that is going in and out from the node. Represented as:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
k_{node}^{in} \text{ , } k_{node}^{out}
\end{eqnarray}$$

Furthermore, the average of them on the graph must be the same:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\overline{k^{in}} = \overline{k^{out}} 
\end{eqnarray}$$
