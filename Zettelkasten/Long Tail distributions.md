*Long tail distributions* are [[Probability Distributions]] that have a large number of occurrences far from the *head*.

The *tail* of the distribution extends far to the left or right of the main body.

*Long-tailed distributions* are significant in many fields because they can describe phenomena where extreme values (either high or low) are more common than would be predicted by bell-shaped distributions like the [[Normal Distribution]].
