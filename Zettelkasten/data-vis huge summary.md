"data visualization is the use of visual representations to explore, make sense of, and communicate data" (Few, S)

*SEE*:
- **S** : Search (explore)
- **E** : Examine (make sense)
- **E** : Explain (communicate)

(_Card et al 1999 - week 2 / pg 4_)

Avoid redundant or distracting features - *maximise the data-ink ratio* ("Every bit of ink on a graphic requires a reason") - use this with parsimony

(_The Visual display of quantitative information_)

Common mistakes:
- unsuitable graphical encodings/chart
- truncated ranges
- wrong axis range
(_Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals - Alberto Cairo 2015_)

Seven task types:
- overview
- zoom
- filter
- details on demand
- relate
- history
- extract

(_Ben Shneiderman 1996_)
# week 2

Minimise chunks of memory used to understand graphs - (_Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few - chap 4.1_)

Avoid Scrolling and avoid multiple tabs/screens

An understanding of what is processed pre-attentively is probably the most important contribution that visual science can make to data visualisation‚Äù (_Information Visualization: Perception for Design, Ware , 2004, p. 149_) - "pop-out effect" information get in less than 300ms

Gestalt principles - how we perceive patterns and forms:
- proximity - relative distance between objs
 ![[Pasted image 20240307170704.png|200]]
- similarity - similar form
![[Pasted image 20240307170822.png|200]]
- enclosure - highlighting a subset of data points
![[Pasted image 20240307170901.png|200]]
- continuity - aligned objets or following a trajectory
![[Pasted image 20240307170954.png|200]]
- common fate - move in the same direction
![[Pasted image 20240307171029.png|200]]
- connection - connected objects are grouped
![[Pasted image 20240307171117.png|200]]

**Three component limit**, otherwise: effortful + serial + slow!

too many retinal variables

Encoding quantities - Position, length, angle, area, volume and colour (_Graphical Perception, Cleveland and McGiil, 1984_)

(_Automating the Design of Graphical Presentations of Relational Information, Mackinlay 1986_)
Order of the encoding on quantitative data:

Avoid **Inattentional blindness** (_Gorillas in our midsts: sustained inattentional blindness
for dynamic events - Simons and Chabris, 1999_) - So focus in something that we miss the obvious

Avoid **Change blindness** (_Change detection - Rensink, 2002_) - Take significant time to people to notice a change in a visual scene, if they are distracted and not look for it

The conclusion of last two points: perception is fallible! Small changes in a complex environment without focus can lead unnoticed! Continuity in view transformation is key to help users.
