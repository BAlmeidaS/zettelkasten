*Measure of Unreliability* is how much you cannot trust in something, like a test. 

*Unreliability* goes up when we increase [[Variance]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge unreliability \propto s^2 $$

*Unreliability* goes down when we increase the [[Sample Size]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge unreliability \propto \dfrac{s^2}{n} $$
