[[Breadth-first search]] vs [[Depth-first search]]

The memory requirements are a biiger problem for breadth-first search than the execution time. Therefore usually is better to use DFS than BFS.

If the search state space is larger than the memory, and the depth is of the solution is not known, best one is [[Iterative-deepening search]].
