A *vector space* (over a [[field]] $\displaystyle \large F$) is a set $\displaystyle \large V$ with *two operations*:

- *Vector Addition*: An operation that takes *two vectors* $\displaystyle \large u, v \in V$ and produces another vector $\displaystyle \large (u+v) \in V$

- *Scalar Multiplication*: An operation that takes a *scalar* $\displaystyle \large a \in F$ (element of the [[field]]) and a vector $\displaystyle \large v \in V$

*Both operations must satisfy a specific collection of [[axioms]]*:
