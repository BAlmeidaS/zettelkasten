This paper analyzes homophily measures and proposes a new characteristic highly correlated with performance. Specifically, the authors suggest desirable properties for the metric and show that current homophily measures do not satisfy some important properties, so suggest a new homophily measure to satisfy them. Furthermore, beyond homophily arguments, the authors suggest a new characteristic that is more highly correlated with performance from the perspective of the usefulness of neighbor labels to predict the label of the corresponding center node. They demonstrate that the correlation between the values of proposed measures and performance is significantly higher than current homophily measures on various architectures and datasets.
