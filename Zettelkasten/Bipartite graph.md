A common type of [[Graphs|Graph]] when:
- There are two distinct types of nodes: Red and Green for instance
- Nodes *only interact* with the other Node type

So, the *Nodes* can be divided into two disjoint sets $\displaystyle \large U$ and $\displaystyle \large V$.
The *Edges* connect only nodes from $\displaystyle \large U$ to nodes to $\displaystyle \large V$

Bipartite graphs are defined as $\displaystyle \large G(U, V, E)$
