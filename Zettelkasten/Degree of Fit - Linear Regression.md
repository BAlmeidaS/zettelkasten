The degree of fit, $\displaystyle \large r^2$, quantifies the degree of fit of a [[Regression Analysis|Linear Model]]
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
r^2 &=& 1 - \dfrac{SSE}{SSY} = \dfrac{SSR}{SSY} 
\\\\\ r^2 &\in&[0,1]

\end{eqnarray}$$
([[Sum of squares errors|SSE]], [[SSY]], [[SSR]])

In other words, **$\displaystyle \large r^2$ is the percentage of the *variation* that the model could explain.**

The square root of this quantity is $\displaystyle \large r$ in [[Pearson's correlation]] and $\displaystyle \large \rho$ in [[Sperman's rank correlation]]
