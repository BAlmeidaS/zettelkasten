Make decision about a [[Hypothesis]]. To define whether there is enough evidence in the [[Sample data]] to reject the [[Null Hypothesis]] or fail to reject it.

The hypothesis test consists in:
- Defining the overall procedure - including:
	- [[Null Hypothesis]] and [[Alternative Hypothesis]]
	- Selecting a [[Significance Level]] to determine the threshold for statistical significance
- Defining the [[Test Statistic]] that, generally, will return a p-value that the test will use to take a decision

Different *statistical tests* use different [[Test Statistic]]:
- In a [[t-test]], the test statistic is the t-statistic.
- In a [[chi-squared test]], the test statistic is the chi-squared statistic.
- In an [[F test]] the test statistic is the F-statistic.
