*Loss Function* is a type of [[objective function]] where the *goal is to minimise some measure of loss*. Usually defined as $\displaystyle \large \mathcal{L}$.

It is often used interchangeably with [[cost function]], but being more rigorous, *loss function* is related to the *performance on the a **single data point***. 

Typical cases of loss functions are [[Mean squared Error]] and [[Cross-entropy]]
