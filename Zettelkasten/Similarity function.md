Similarity functions are *soft* [[distance]]. They measure how dissimilar is one object of the other in a set.

They usually don't fulfil all the properties of [[distance]], especially the triangle inequality. Therefore, *similarity function are **not** distances*, though, we can say that *every **distance** is a dissimilarity function*.

The general properties of *dissimilarity functions*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
1.& & 0 \le s(x,y) \le 1 \\
2.& & s(x,x) = 1 \\
3.& & s(x,y) = s(y,x) \text{ (symmetry)}
\end{eqnarray}$$
