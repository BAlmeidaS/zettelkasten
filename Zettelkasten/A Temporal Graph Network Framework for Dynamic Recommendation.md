This paper addresses the limitations of static recommender systems by implementing Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) to better capture evolving user preferences over time. Traditional models often fail to account for the dynamic nature of user-item interactions, leading to outdated recommendations. TGNs, originally proposed for other dynamic scenarios, provide a robust solution by maintaining long-term dependencies and updating node embeddings based on historical data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of TGNs in real-world datasets, achieving superior performance in capturing temporal dynamics compared to traditional static and sequential models, thereby offering more relevant and timely recommendations.
