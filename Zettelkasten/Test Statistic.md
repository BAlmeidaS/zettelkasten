A specific numerical value, usually [[p-value]], calculated from [[sample data]] as part of a [[Hypothesis Test]].

The *test statistic* is used to determine whether **to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.**

Pay attention:
- **Reject null hypothesis**, instead of, ~~accept alternative hypothesis~~
- **Fail to reject null hypothesis**, instead of, ~~accept null hypothesis~~ or ~~reject alternative hypothesis~~
