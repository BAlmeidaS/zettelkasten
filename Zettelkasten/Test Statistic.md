The test statistic is a number calculated from the data that is used to assess the truth of a null hypothesis in the context of a [[Hypothesis Test|Statistical Test]].

Then we calculate how likely are we to obtain a test statistic this big (or bigger) if the null hypothesis is true? And this per definition is the calculation of the p-value

The *test statistic* is used to determine whether **to reject or fail to reject** the [[Null Hypothesis]].

Pay attention:
- **Reject null hypothesis**, instead of, ~~accept alternative hypothesis~~
- **Fail to reject null hypothesis**, instead of, ~~accept null hypothesis~~ or ~~reject alternative hypothesis~~
