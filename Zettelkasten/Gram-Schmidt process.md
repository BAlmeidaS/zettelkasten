A process to transform any [[basis]] into an [[orthonormal basis]].

A *basis* (composed by [[linear independence|linear independent]] vectors) $\displaystyle \large v$ can be defined as:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
v &=& \{v_1, v_2, \dots,v_n\}
\end{eqnarray}$$

*Gram-Schmidt* normalises it like this:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
e_1 = \dfrac{v_1}{|v1|}
\end{eqnarray}$$

Explanation:

1. The first arbitrary vector, $\displaystyle \large e_1$, is just its original form, normalised.

The second arbitrary vector, $\displaystyle \large e_2$, is the perpendicular part of $\displaystyle \large v_2$ in relation to $\displaystyle \large e_1$.
