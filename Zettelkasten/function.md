A function $\displaystyle \large f$ is *a collection of pairs of number*, from a **set X** and a **set Y**, such that *each element of X is assign to exactly one element of Y*.

Set X is called [[domain of a function]]
Set Y is called [[codomain of a function]]

It is the set of all possible input to $\displaystyle \large f$.
