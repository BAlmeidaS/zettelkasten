The *scalar projection* of a vector $\displaystyle \large a$ on a vector $\displaystyle \large b$, is the [[Modulus of a vector|modulus]] of the projection:

In other words, $\displaystyle \large |a_1|$, and it can be worked out as:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
|a_1| &=& \dfrac{a \cdot b}{|b|}
\end{eqnarray}$$
