Regarding a [[Bipartite graph]] that has two sets of nodes, $\displaystyle \large U$ and $\displaystyle \large V$, we can define a *Projection of a set $\displaystyle \large U$*, as the nodes that share the same nodes from $\displaystyle \large V$:

$\displaystyle \large Projection\ U = G(U, E^\prime)$
