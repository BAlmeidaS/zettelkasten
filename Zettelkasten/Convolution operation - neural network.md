On the concept of [[Neural networks]], the convolution operation involves applying a filter (also called a kernel) to the input data (e.g., an image) to produce a feature map. 

The filter is a small matrix that slides over the input data, *computing the sum of element-wise multiplications at each position*.

This is inspired by the mathematical concept of [[Convolution]]
