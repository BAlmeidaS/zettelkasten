This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the performance of well-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on unseen test graphs without ground-truth labels. Traditional evaluation methods that rely on annotated datasets are not applicable in real-world scenarios where test graphs are unlabeled. The paper proposes a two-stage evaluation framework: DiscGraph set construction and GNNEvaluator training and inference. The framework effectively captures the distribution discrepancies between training and test graphs, models graph structural discrepancies, and estimates node classification accuracy without labeled data. Experimental results indicate the success of the proposed method.
