The paper extends the notion of Dirichlet energy to define oversmoothing in directed graphs. It introduces a fractional Laplacian operator that is used to create graph neural ODE architectures. The resulting designs are non-local and can alleviate oversmoothing. The paper provides empirical results (accuracy) on nine real-world benchmarks for node classification.

The first discussion (last on the page) is very interesting on open review.
