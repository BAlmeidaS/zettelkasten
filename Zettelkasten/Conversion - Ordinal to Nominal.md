A conversion from a [[Numerical variables]]([[interval variable]] or [[ratio variable]]) to an [[nominal variable]]

In such conversion the new [[categorical variable]] we *don't care about the order*

To do this we can create arbitrary clusters, like, changing a *numerical variable* age to some categories like *common, not-common, rare*

Or we can use [[Clustering|cluster analysis]] to create such categories.
