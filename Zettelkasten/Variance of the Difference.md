If two samples, $\displaystyle \large A$ and $\displaystyle \large B$, are [[Independent Samples]], the *[[Variance]] of the difference is the sum of the two sample variances*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \sigma^2_{\bar{y}_A-\bar{y}_B} = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2$$

Not true if the samples are correlated, thus, not independent.
