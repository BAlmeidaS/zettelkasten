[[Variance|Variances]] hold an important property called *Additive of Variances*. Which states how to sum [[Variance|Variances]] of two different [[Random Variable|random variables]] using their [[Covariance]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
Var(A+B) = Var(A) + Var(B) - Cov(A,B)
\end{eqnarray}$$
