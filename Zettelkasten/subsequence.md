A **subsequence** is any sequence that can be derived from another [[sequence|array]] by deleting some elements **without changing the order** of the remaining elements.

Given the array
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
arr &=& [1, 3, 5, 12, 32]
\end{eqnarray}$$

These are examples of *subsequences*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
subsequence &=& [1, 3, 5]
\\
subsequence &=& [1, 5, 32]
\end{eqnarray}$$

The object $\displaystyle \large [1, 12, 5]$ it is *not* a subsequence, *because it does not keep the order*. This object is a [[subset]].
