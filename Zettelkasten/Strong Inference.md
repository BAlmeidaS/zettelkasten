*Strong* [[Inference]] is composed of:
- A clear [[Hypothesis]]
- An acceptable [[Hypothesis Test|Statistical Test]] that says unequivocally is the hypothesis is true or false

Both are equally important.

*A great many scientific experiments appear to be carried out with no particular hypothesis in mind at all, but simply to see what happens. While this approach may be commendable in the early stages of a study, such experiments tend to be weak as an end in themselves, because there will be such a large number of equally plausible explanations for the results. Without contemplation there will be no testable predictions; without testable predictions there will be no experimental ingenuity; without experimental ingenuity there is likely to be inadequate control; in short, equivocal interpretation. The results could be due to myriad plausible causes. Nature has no stake in being understood by scientists. We need to work at it. Without replication, randomization and good controls we shall make little progress.*
