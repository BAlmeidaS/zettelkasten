A *polynomial* is a mathematical [[function]] involving a sum of terms, each term consisting of a constant coefficient multiplied by one or more variables raised to non-negative integer powers.

Polynomials may involve operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but not division by a variable. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of any variable in the expression.

Expressions like are polynomials:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f(x,y) &=& 4x + 7xy^2 + 2 \\
f(x) &=& x^7 + 3 \\
f(x,y,z) &=& 6x - z + yx^2z^3
\end{eqnarray}$$

While this is *not* a polynomial,
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f(x,y)&=&\dfrac{5x}{y} \\
\text{or} \\
f(x)&=&3^{2x}
\end{eqnarray}$$
Because,
1. $\displaystyle \large y$ *has a negative exponent ($\displaystyle \large -1$)*
2. *the exponent is variable ($\displaystyle \large 2x$)*
