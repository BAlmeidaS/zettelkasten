A [[matrix]] that contains only 1s in the its main diagonal, and 0s elsewhere.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
I_2 &=& \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \\\\
I_3 &=& \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \\\\
\cdots
\end{eqnarray}$$

This matrix, *does not change anything in the space*
(refer to [[how matrices transform space]])
