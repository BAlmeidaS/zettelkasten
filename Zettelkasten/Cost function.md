*Cost Function* is a type of [[objective function]] where the *goal is to minimise some measure of cost*.

It is often used interchangeably with [[loss function]], but being more rigorous, *cost function* is related to the *performance on the **whole dataset***. It is typically the sum or average of the [[loss function]] over all the training samples.
