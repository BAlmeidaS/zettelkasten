*Genetic Programming* is a strategy, not proved as good, to generate code automatically. The idea is, using [[Tree encoding]] we can evaluate code randomly generated using **Function** and **terminals** and applying [[Mutation]] and [[Crossover]] to find solutions for problems.

Usually you capture the behaviour that you want to understand in a **table** and create code with *GP* that fits better and better that **table**.

An example of a tree found with functions as squares and terminals as circles:
