In general there are *3 criteria to evaluate* [[Clustering]].

1. External criteria
	By using *external/expert knowledge* to validate the pattern found, and create a score with this, maybe with [[Jaccard Similarity]]
2. Internal criteria
	Test against quantities and features inside the dataset, using *cluster compactness/separation* or [[silhouette score]]
3. Relative criteria
