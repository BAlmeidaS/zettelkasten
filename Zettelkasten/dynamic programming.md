*Dynamic Programming* (DP) is a paradigma that can *systematically and efficiently explore **all possible solutions** of a problem*.

Such problems have usually two characteristics:
1. the problem can be *broken down into **overlapping subproblems*** :
	smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times
2. the problem has an *optimal structure* :
	An optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems



Important to notice that:
- [[greedy algorithm]] have optimal substracture, *but **not** overlapping subproblems*.
- [[Divide and Conquer algorithms]]  break a problem into subproblems, *but these subproblems are **no
