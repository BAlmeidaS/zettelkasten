This paper proposes a [[Graph Transformer Networks]] architecture that aggregates the neighbourhood features from different hops and treats them as a sequence of token vectors for the transformer. It shows improved expressive power with information from multi-hop neighbourhoods. The authors theoretically analyse that the proposed method has more expressive power than decoupled GCN.

The review mention [[Recipe for a General, Powerful, Scalable Graph Transformer]] as a potential related work
