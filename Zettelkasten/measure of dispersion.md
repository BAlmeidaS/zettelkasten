A measure of dispersion is a statistical term that describes the spread or variability of a set of data points around a [[Central Tendency]].

It provides insight into how much the data values differ from each other, indicating the degree of spread or concentration of data points in a dataset. Dispersion measures are crucial for understanding the distribution and reliability of data, helping to complement the information provided by measures of central tendency.

Examples are [[Range]], [[Interquartile Range|IQR]], [[Variance]] and [[Standard Deviation]]
