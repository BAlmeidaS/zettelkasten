The authors propose an active learning method for GNNs, extending the Expected Model Change Maximization (EMCM) principle to GNNs. A Bayesian interpretation for the node embeddings generated by GNNs under the semi-supervised setting is presented. By establishing a connection with expected prediction error minimization, theoretical guarantees for AL performance are driven. The numerical experiments shows improved performance and runtime compared to the existing approaches.
