The **Power** of a [[Hypothesis Test]] has to do with the [[Type II error]].

It is the probability of *accepting* the [[Null Hypothesis]] when it is false.

$$\displaystyle \Huge Power = 1 - \beta$$

An acceptable *power* is something around 0.8, therefore, $\displaystyle \large \beta$ should be 0.2

*QUESTION: How can I get the power of a test in R?*
