Range is the *distance between the biggest value to the smallest"*. It is a reasonable measure but it is too dependent on outlying values.

Also it relies only on the two most extreme cases, we prefer metrics that show [[Variability]] using all the data.
$$\displaystyle \Huge range(x) = max(x) - min(x)$$
