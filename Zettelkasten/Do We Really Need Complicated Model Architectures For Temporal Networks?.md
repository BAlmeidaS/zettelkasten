In this paper, they carefully design and propose the GraphMixer network for temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs. With a carefully designed and ablate architecture separated into three components, the link-encoder, node-encoder, and MLP-Mixer based link classifier, they are able to achieve high performance on this task that has only previously been attained with RNN and Self-Attention based architectures. They include extensive experiments to study the different architecture choices they made and their effect on performance and generalization.
