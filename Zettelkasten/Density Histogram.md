Density histogram is a special [[Histogram]], the y-axis represents the density rather than the raw count of data points in each bin.

**Density Calculation**: In a density histogram, the area of each bin (not the height) represents the proportion of the dataset that falls into that bin. The density for each bin is calculated as the number of points in the bin divided by the product of the total number of data points and the bin width.

**Density vs. Frequency**: A density value of 0.5 does not mean that 50% of your data is in that bin. Rather, it means that the density (frequency per unit on the x-axis) of observations in that bin is 0.5.
