The [[function]] $\displaystyle \large f$ is [[differentiable]] at a if
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\ \ \text{exists.}
\end{eqnarray}$$

the [[limit]] is denotated by $\displaystyle \large f^\prime(a)$ and is called the **derivative of $\displaystyle \large f$ at $\displaystyle \large a$**.

>if $\displaystyle \large f$ is [[differentiable]] at $\displaystyle \large a$, then, $\displaystyle \large f$ is [[continuous function|continuous]] at $\displaystyle \large a$
