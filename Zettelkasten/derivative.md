The *derivative* is the *rate* at which a [[function]] value changes at some point.

It is defined as $\displaystyle \large f^\prime(x)$ or $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{df}{dx}$:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f^\prime(x) = \dfrac{df(x)}{dx} =
\lim_{x \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{eqnarray}$$

$\displaystyle \large f^\prime(a)$ is called the **derivative of $\displaystyle \large f$ at $\displaystyle \large a$**.

In 2 dimensions is often refereed as the **slope** of the curve
