*Natural numbers* or *Naturals* are defined as $\displaystyle \large \mathbb{N}$

It is the set of all positive numbers (authors often exclude $\displaystyle \large 0$, there is no standard related to this!)

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\mathbb{N} &=& \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}
\\or\\\
\mathbb{N} &=& \{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}
\end{eqnarray}$$
