*Serverless* is a way to run code, *without provisioning and managing servers*.

*Cloud providers* take care of how to run the code, there is no provision or concern about the one that is deploying.

#### Pros
- No servers to provision, manage, or upgrade
- Pay for the compute time we consume
- Automated [[Scalability]] based on load

**Particular useful for small tasks** that are performed in response to an event.

#### Cons
- **technical limitations** (memory size, invocation duration, ...)
- can be *expensive when at scale*
