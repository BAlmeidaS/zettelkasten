if I have a [[vector]] $\displaystyle \large v$ describe in the basic [[basis]]. Then, I have another basis, $\displaystyle \large A$, If I want to know how $\displaystyle \large v$ will be described in $\displaystyle \large A$, I have to:
1. Create the matrix transformation $\displaystyle \large T$ that maps $\displaystyle \large A$ to basic basis - using [[Matrix as Linear Transformations]]
2. I have to find the [[Matrix Inverse]] of $\displaystyle \large T$
3. then compute, $\displaystyle \large T^{-1}v = v_A$
