[[dot product]] can be also defined using the angle between the vectors and the [[Modulus of a vector|modulus]] of the vectors (the proof comes from applying [[cosine rule]]):

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
r\cdot s &=& |r|*|s|*cos(\theta) \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

Thus, **dot product can be used to see alignment between the vectors**

When they are parallel in the same direction => $\displaystyle \large cos(\theta) = 1$
When they are parallel in the opposite direction => $\displaystyle \large cos(\theta) = -1$

*When dot-product (a specific case of inner product) is 0 the vectors are **orthogonal** and this comes by the definition of [[Orthogonal]]*
