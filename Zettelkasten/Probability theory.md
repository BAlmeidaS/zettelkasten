The tools to deal with degrees of beliefs - or to the uncertain about facts

Defined with 3 axioms:

1. Probability of an event is a non-negative real number: $$\displaystyle \Huge P(Event) \in \mathbb{R}, P(event) \ge 0 \ \ \ \ \forall event \in F$$
$$\text{$F$ is the event space}$$
2. Probability of the entire sample space is one: $$\displaystyle \Huge P(\Omega) = 1$$
