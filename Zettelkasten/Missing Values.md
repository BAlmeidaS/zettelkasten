Commonly on [[input data]] there will be missing values.

They can be:
1. Missing values in several [[Attribute|attributes]]
2. Missing values in a number of [[instance|records]]

Apart from remove these records two other things can be made:
1. Replace them before modelling
2. Use models that can deal with missing values

This table presented on the book *cluster analysis* might be a start point
