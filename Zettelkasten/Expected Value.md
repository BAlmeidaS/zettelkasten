In [[Statistics]] and [[Probability theory]],

*The expected value is equal to the [[Average|Mean]]!*

For a [[Numerical variable]] is:
$$\displaystyle \Huge E[X] = \int\limits^{\infty}_{-\infty}x*f(x)*dx$$
being $\displaystyle \large f(x)$ the [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] of the random variable.

For a [[Categorical variable|Discrete variable]] that has only numbers:
$$\displaystyle \Huge E[X] = \sum\limits_{i}x_i*P(X=x_i)$$
