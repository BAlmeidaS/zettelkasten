A combination of *observation*, *theory* and *experiment* solve scientific problems. 

Usually **one or more must be sacrificed** because of constraints.

The main key concepts are:
- [[An experiment must be reproducible|Replication]]
- [[Randomisation]]

One important part to validate *experiment* is via a [[Hypothesis Test|Statistical Test]].
