Apparently [[Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry|MPNN]] + Virtual Node (Defined inside the paper as a common technique) leverage MPPN to the same layer that [[Graph Transformer Networks]], so their conclusion is that we lack for good benchmarks to prove that GT is better or not than MPPN.

Similar results were find on [[Distinguished In Uniform - Self-Attention Vs. Virtual Nodes]]
