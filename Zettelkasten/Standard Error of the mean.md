*Standard Error* is a [[Standard Errors - Measure of Unreliability]].

Getting from the relations drawn on Unreliability. Since variance has the dimension of the variable squared, it will be *nice to have unreliability in the same dimension of the variable*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge unreliability \propto \sqrt{\dfrac{s^2}{n}} $$

This is the *Standard Error of the mean*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge SE_{\bar{y}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{s^2}{n}} $$

So usually we define [[Average|mean]] as:
$$\displaystyle \Huge mean\ \pm\ SE_{\bar{y}}$$
*Being $\displaystyle \large SE_\bar{y}$ the standard error of the mean and the size of the sample n*

for instance, 
$\displaystyle \large mean = 3.0 \pm 0.364$ being the error the standard error of a sample size of 30.
