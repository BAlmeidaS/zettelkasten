Minimise chunks of memory used to understand graphs - (_Information Dashboard Design, Stephen Few - chap 4.1_)

Avoid Scrolling and avoid multiple tabs/screens

An understanding of what is processed pre-attentively is probably the most important contribution that visual science can make to data visualisation‚Äù (_Information Visualization: Perception for Design, Ware , 2004, p. 149_) - "pop-out effect" information get in less than 300ms

Gestalt principles - how we perceive patterns and forms:
- proximity - relative distance between objs

- similarity - similar form

- enclosure - highlighting a subset of data points
![[Pasted image 20240307170901.png|200]]
- continuity - aligned objets or following a trajectory
![[Pasted image 20240307170954.png|200]]
- common fate - move in the same direction

- connection - connected objects are grouped

**Three component limit**, otherwise: effortful + serial + slow!

Encoding quantities - Position, length, angle, area, volume and colour (_Graphical Perception, Cleveland and McGiil, 1984_)

(_Automating the Design of Graphical Presentations of Relational Information, Mackinlay 1986_)
Order of the encoding on quantitative data:

Avoid **Inattentional blindness** - [[Gorillas in our midsts, sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events, Simons and Chabris, 1999]] - So focused in something that we miss the obvious

Avoid **Change blindness** [[Change detection, Rensink, 2002]] - Take significant time to people to notice a change in a visual scene, if they are distracted and not look for it

The conclusion of last two points: **perception is fallible!** Small changes in a complex environment without focus can lead unnoticed! Continuity in view transformation is key to help users.
