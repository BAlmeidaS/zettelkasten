*Clustering Coefficient* evaluates the *local structure around the [[Vertices|vertice]]*. It measure how connected the neighbours are.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
e_v &=& \dfrac
{\#(\text{edges among neighboring nodes})}
{\binom{k_v}{2}
} \\
e_v &\in& [0, 1]
\end{eqnarray}$$

$\displaystyle \large k_v$ is the [[Node Degree]] of [[Vertices|Node]] $\displaystyle \large v$
