*Paired samples* refer to a set of observations that are made in pairs such that each observation in one sample is uniquely paired with one in the other sample. Maybe because they were made on the same individual, or because they were taken from the same location.

They are not necessarily bad, they are simply a different study design.

Quick reminder: *Both samples should have the same size to be considered paired*
