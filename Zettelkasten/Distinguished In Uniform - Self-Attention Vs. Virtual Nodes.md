Paper that proves that for some cases [[Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry|MPNN]] + Virtual Nodes are better than the [[Graph Transformer Networks|GT]], while in other cases is the opposite. So neither of them are perfect

Similar results were find on [[On the Connection Between MPNN and Graph Transformer]]
