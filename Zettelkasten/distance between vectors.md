The [[distance function|distance]] between two [[vector|vectors]] can be *broadly* defined as the *square root of the [[dot product]] of the difference of the two vectors*:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
given,&&
x \in \mathbb{R}^k \text{ and } y \in \mathbb{R}^k
\\\\
dist(x,y) &=& \lVert x-y\rVert = \sqrt{x\cdot y}
\end{eqnarray}$$
