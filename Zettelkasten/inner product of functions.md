One possible [[inner product]] *of functions*, might be defined as follows:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\langle f, g \rangle = \int^b_af(x)g(x)dx
\end{eqnarray}$$

The *above inner product* is valid because it satisfy all the requisites of inner product. Therefore, we can start understanding [[angle between vectors|angles]] and [[Orthogonal|orthogonality]].

>[!example]
> If we consider the [[inner product]] above, we will find out that $\displaystyle \large sin(x)$ and $\displaystyle \large cos(x)$ are orthogonal, since they reduce into 0.
