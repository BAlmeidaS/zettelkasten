A data structure consisting of an ordered set of elements, each of which may be a number, another list, etc.

A list is usually denoted $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ or $\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$, and may also be interpreted as a vector (specifically, an n-vector) or an n-tuple.

Multiplicity matters in a list, so (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2) are not equivalent.
