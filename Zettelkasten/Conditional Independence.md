Basically when we have *two* [[Random Variable]]s that can be considered independent **because** of a *third* variable

So, maybe $\displaystyle \large X$ and $\displaystyle \large Y$ are not independent, but in light of $\displaystyle \large Z$ they become
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
&P&(X,Y \mid Z) = P(X\mid Z)*P(Y\mid Z) \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

"*Conditional independence assertions can allow probabilistic systems to scale up; moreover, they are much more commonly available than absolute independence assertions.*"
