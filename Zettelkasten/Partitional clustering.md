*Partitional clustering* is a type of [[hard clustering]] without any hierarchical structure.

**number of clusters is specified a priori**

The method is typically starting with an initial partitioning and then interactively relocates data points to improve the partitioning based on a specific criterion.

Examples are [[k-means]] and [[dbscan]]
