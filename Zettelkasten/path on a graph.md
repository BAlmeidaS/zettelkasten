A *Path* in a [[Graphs|Graph]] is a *sequence of vertices* such that each adjacent pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

A path $\displaystyle \large P$ in a graph $\displaystyle \large G(V, E)$ is a sequences of vertices $\displaystyle \large v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$ where $\displaystyle \large v_i \in V$ for $\displaystyle \large 1\le i\le k$  and $\displaystyle \large (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$, for $\displaystyle \large 1\le i \le k$
