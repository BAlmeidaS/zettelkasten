*Non-orthogonal Data* refers to datasets where the *variables are NOT independent* of each other and *may share some common information*.

In [[Statistics|statistical]] analysis, *non-orthogonality* can complicate the analysis and interpretation of data because the relationships among variables are confounded. This can lead to biased estimates of parameters in statistical models, unless the model is adjusted to account for the non-orthogonality.

*non-orthogonal data, order matters!*
