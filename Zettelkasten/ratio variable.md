*Ratio variables* are [[Numerical variables]] that have all the properties of [[interval variable]] *with addition of a meaningful zero point*. This means you can say that one value is twice as much as another. 

Ratio variables can be fully ordered, have equally spaced intervals, and allow for a meaningful zero value, indicating the absence of the measured entity.
