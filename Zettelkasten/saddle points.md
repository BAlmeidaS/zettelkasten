a particular *critical point* on [[multivariable function]], is neither maximum nor minimum but its [[gradient]] is $\displaystyle \large 0$.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}$$
Its form is like this

To be a *saddle point* it must be a [[Critical Points|critical point]] and lay down in a specific case of the [[second-partial derivative test]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_f(\boldsymbol{x_0}) &=& \vec{0}
\\
D(\boldsymbol{x_0}) &<& 0
\end{eqnarray}$$
