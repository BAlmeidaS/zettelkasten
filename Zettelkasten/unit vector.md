the vector $\displaystyle \large v$ is a *unite vector* if its [[Modulus of a vector|modulus]] is 1. 
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\lvert \lvert v \rvert \rvert = 1
\end{eqnarray}$$

This is also called *normalisation of a vector*

The unit vector is represented with a "hat" and, any vector $\displaystyle \large v$ can be transformed to *unit vector* $\displaystyle \large v$:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\hat{v} &=& \dfrac{v}{|v|} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

The divisor is usually the [[Euclidean Norm|l2 norm]] of the vector
