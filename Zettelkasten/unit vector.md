Unit vector is a vector with [[Modulus of a vector|modulus]] 1.

The unit vector is represented with a "hat" and, any vector $\displaystyle \large v$ can be transformed to *unit vector* $\displaystyle \large v$:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\hat{v} &=& \dfrac{v}{|v|} \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
