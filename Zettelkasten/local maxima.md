In [[multivariable function]], there might be many points that can be considered *local maxima* (*maxima* is plural of *maximum*).

All the *red-arrows* point to *local maxima*,
but only the one circled in *green* is also the *global maximum*.

To be a *local maxima* a point must *at least* meet the following criteria (using the [[gradient]]):
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_f(x,y) = \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}$$
This means that all the [[partial derivatives]] must be $\displaystyle \large 0$, or the [[tangent plane]] must be flat.

This is not enough, because this condition in isolation is the same for [[local minima]] and [[saddle points]]
