*Normal distribution* is a symmetric, bell curve that has the [[Average|mean]], [[Median]] and [[Mode]] located in the same place at the center.

The normal distribution formula can be remembered as,

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
bell\_curve &=& e^{x^2} \\ 
f(x) \sum a 
\boldsymbol{N}(\mu, \sigma)  f(x) &=& e^{cx^2} \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
