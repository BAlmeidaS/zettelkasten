*Normal distribution* is a symmetric, bell curve that has the [[Average|mean]], [[Median]] and [[Mode]] located in the same place at the center.

The normal distribution formula is,
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
bell\ curve &=& e^{-x^2} \\ \\

f(x) &\sim& \boldsymbol{N}(\mu, \sigma) \\
f(x) &=& \dfrac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{{-\dfrac{1}{2}}\left(\dfrac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2} \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
