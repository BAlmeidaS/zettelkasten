The main goal of [[feature]] *extraction* is to extract core features from the data by *transforming the data* to a more suitable information.

This idea is very much connected with [[dimensionality reduction]]. But can also be performed to increase *information representation*, creating features that capture the essential information more efficiently.

Examples:
- [[Principal Component Analysis]]
- [[Autoencoders]]
