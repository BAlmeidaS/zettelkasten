[[Rule-based system - Expert system|Expert Systems]] have the knowledge separated from its processing (Inference engine and Knowledge base are isolated) 

- This enables a more natural way to represent knowledge
- Decouple the "engineering part" from the "knowledgeable part"
- Details of implementation are not relevant when discussing "knowledge"
