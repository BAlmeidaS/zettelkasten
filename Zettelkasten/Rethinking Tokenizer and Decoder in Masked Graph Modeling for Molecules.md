This paper mainly revisits the graph tokenizers and the graph autoencoders in Masked Graph Modeling (MGM) frameworks. Authors examine the roles of different tokenizers as the MGMâ€™s reconstructions targets and propose a simple GNN-based tokenizer method and a decoding strategy. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the designed tokenizer and decoding strategy, as well as some insightful findings.
