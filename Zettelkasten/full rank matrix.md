A [[matrix]] is called *full rank* when it has the highest possible values for its [[rank of a matrix|rank]]. Which means that its [[rank of a matrix|rank]] *is the lesser number between **number of columns** or **number of rows***.

All the columns (or rows, which one was lesser) are *linear independent*.
