Also named as $\large b^*$

$\Large N$ - total number of nodes generated by a [[A* search]] using some [[Heuristic]] $h1$
$\Large d$ - solution depth found

than $\large b^*$ can be found as:
$$\displaystyle \Huge N+1=1+b^* + (b^*)^2 + \ldots + (b^*)^d$$

The solution has two good approximations:

if $\large b^*$ is a large value:
$$\displaystyle \Huge b^* \approx N^{\tfrac{1}{d}}$$

The precise value is the [[sum of geometric series]]
$$\displaystyle \Huge N + 1 = \dfrac{1 - (b^*)^{d+1}}{1 - b^*}$$
