The *order* of a term in a [[polynomial]] is the *number of variables in that term*.

- the order of $\displaystyle \large x^2$  is $\displaystyle \large 2$.
- the order of $\displaystyle \large 2y^3$  is $\displaystyle \large 3$.
- the order of $\displaystyle \large 7x^2y^3$  is $\displaystyle \large 5$.
