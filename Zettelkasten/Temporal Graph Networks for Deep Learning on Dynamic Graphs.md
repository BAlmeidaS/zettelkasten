The paper "Temporal Graph Networks for Deep Learning on Dynamic Graphs" introduces Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), an innovative framework for effectively handling dynamic graphs, which evolve over time with events such as node or edge additions. TGNs leverage a unique combination of memory modules and graph-based operators to outperform previous methods both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The model maintains node-specific memories that are updated with each event, capturing long-term dependencies. It supports continuous-time dynamic graphs, unlike traditional models that handle static or discrete-time snapshots. TGNs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both transductive and inductive tasks across various datasets, including Wikipedia, Reddit, and Twitter, showing their versatility and superior efficiency.
