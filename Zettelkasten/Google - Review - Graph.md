Graph is a structure composed of nodes and edges $\displaystyle \large G = (N, E)$

The edges might be directed or undirected. If is directed, each edge is represented as a *ordered pair*. If it is undirected, each edge is represented as a *set*.

When discussing Graphs, space and time complexity are measured related to the number of nodes $\displaystyle \large |N|$ and the number of edges $\displaystyle \large |E|$.

The graph might be weighted or unweighted. It differs basically by the fact that the edge has a number (weight) associated with it.

two types of search are the most common one:
- [[Google - Review - DFS]]
- [[Google - Review - BFS]]
