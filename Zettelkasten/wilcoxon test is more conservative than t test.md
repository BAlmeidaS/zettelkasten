If we can apply the [[Student's t test|t test]] to compare two means of two samples, typically, [[Student's t test|t test]] will give a p-value *smaller* than if we apply [[Wilcoxon's test]].

Therefore, *Wilcoxon test is said to be conservative*. Their p-values will be, usually, highers than the ones from t test.
