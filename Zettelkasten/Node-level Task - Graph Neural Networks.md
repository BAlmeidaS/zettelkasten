Given a [[Graphs|Graph]] $\displaystyle \large G = (V, E)$, learn a function where:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{eqnarray}$$

*Some nodes are labelled on the graph and we want to label all of them*

Features (manually designed) that might be useful:
- [[Node Degree as feature|Node Degree]]
- [[Node Centrality]]
- [[Clustering Coefficient]]
- [[Graphlets]] and [[Graphlet Degree Vector]]
