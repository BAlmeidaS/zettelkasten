*Interaction* transforms data vis from a passive activity to an active/exploratory activity.

from the coursework grading:
- Successful application of an *interactive filter*, clearly demonstrated in the story that supports the answering of a question
- Successful application of multiple view coordination using *brushing and linking* or at least one *shared interactive filter* that support the answering of a complex question

Interactive tasks (_Shneiderman, 1996_):
- Zoom and filter
- details on demand
- Relate, history and extract
- scroll and pan
- location probes and selections - brushing
- group and highlight
- open/expand and close/collapse
- sort and rearrange

So basically, **Visibility of controls + Clear Feedback**

*Interaction design principles*:
- *Constraints* - clear ranges in variables, disable or hide irrelevant options and minimise errors.
- *Consistency* - Similar look should imply similar functionality, don't move controls

*Direct manipulation*:
- Interaction should be **directly** with the graphical artefacts, not separeted
- **Brushing and Linking**:
	- *linking*: change in parameter in one view, reflect in the others
	- *brushing*: select a subset of data points
