The idea is create a system with *fuzzy rules*, they are based on [[Fuzzy Sets]], and they are [[Fuzzy rules vs Crisp Rules|kind of different of normal rules]] that we are used to.

The idea is very similar with based rule system but the rules are defined using [[Fuzzy Sets]], in a [[Fuzzy rules vs Crisp Rules|different way]]. It returns a not precise definition, but a fuzzy definition. To make it return a *crisp* inference, in the end the result must be [[Defuzzification]]

The process of such system are composed in 4 steps:
1. [[Fuzzification]]
2. [[Rule Evaluation in Fuzzy Systems]]
3. [[Aggregation of Rules outputs]]
4. [[Defuzzification]]
