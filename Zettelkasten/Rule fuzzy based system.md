The idea is very similar with the [[Rule-based system - Expert system]] but the rules are defined using [[Fuzzy Sets]], in a [[Fuzzy rules vs Crisp Rules|different way]]. So it returns a not precise definition, it depends on the [[Membership Function]]. To make the proper inference, in the end the result must be [[Defuzzification]]

The process of such system are composed in 4 steps:
1. [[Fuzzification]]
2. [[Rule Evaluation in Fuzzy Systems]]
3. [[Aggregation of Rules outputs]]
4. [[Defuzzification]]
