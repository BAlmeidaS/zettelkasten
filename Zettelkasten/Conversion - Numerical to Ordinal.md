A conversion from a [[Numerical variables]]([[interval variable]] or [[ratio variable]]) to an [[ordinal variable]].

In such conversion the new [[categorical variable]] *must have an order or ranking*.

To do this we can create arbitrary clusters, like, changing a *numerical variable* age to some ranges like *[0-10], [10-20], ...*.

Or we can use [[Clustering|cluster analysis]] to create such categories
