Vector is a set of attributes that describes an object:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
x = \begin{bmatrix}  x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}$$

In mathematical terms if the *length* of $\displaystyle \large x$ is $\displaystyle \large k$, and its *components are real numbers*, then $\displaystyle \large x$ is defined as:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
x \in \mathbb{R}^N
\end{eqnarray}$$
