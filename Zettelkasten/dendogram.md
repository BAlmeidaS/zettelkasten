A dendrogram is a branching diagram that represents the relationships of similarity among a group of [[instance|instances]].

A *dendogram* is an *n-tree* in which each node is associated with a height satisfying the condition:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
h(A) \le h(B) \iff A \subseteq B
\end{eqnarray}$$
