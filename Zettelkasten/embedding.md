*Embeddings* are a type of representation used in machine learning and deep learning to convert high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional [[vector|vectors]].

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m, n > m
\end{eqnarray}$$

$\displaystyle \large \mathbb{R}^ n$: is known as the *original space*
$\displaystyle \large \mathbb{R}^m$: is known as the *embedding space*

These *vectors* capture the semantic meaning or essential characteristics of the data in a continuous, dense format.

Embeddings are particularly useful because they *allow comparison, manipulation, and analysis of data in a more computationally efficient and meaningful way*.
