Data must be *iid* to [[Statistics]] and [[Machine Learning]]

A data is **iid** when *each datapoint is*:
- *independent*: The data-points are independent of each other. The occurrence of one does not affect or give information about the other.
- *identically distributed*: The data-points are drawn from the same [[Probability Distributions|probability distribution]]. Which means they share the same Mean, Variance, and distribution shape.
