A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by _**recursively**_ breaking the problem down into *two or more subproblems* of the same or related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly [**[1]**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm). Then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.
