In [[Statistics]], non-significant means that we observed a variation that we might expect to occur by chance. Maybe because the experiment was too small or maybe because they are not different as well.

Being non-significant is something good sometimes. *Knowing that things are similar (not different) has as great value as knowing they are different.*
