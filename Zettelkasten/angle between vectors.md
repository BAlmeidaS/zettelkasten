The most *broad way* to define *angle between vectors* is by using the relation of the [[cosine]] of the angle and [[inner product]] and [[Modulus of a vector|norm]]:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\cos \theta = \dfrac{\langle x,y \rangle}{\lvert \lvert x \rvert \rvert *\lvert \lvert y \rvert \rvert}
\end{eqnarray}$$

*The **angle** between two vectors might translate **how similar the two vectors are***.

when, $\displaystyle \large \cos \theta = 0$, we say that *$\displaystyle \large x$ and $\displaystyle \large y$ are [[orthogonal vectors]]*.

The *angle* between the vectors *is defined with respect of the [[inner product]] used*.
