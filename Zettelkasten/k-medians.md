*K-medians* is a [[Partitional clustering]], more specifically a [[centre-based clustering]].

It is an extension of [[k-means]], but it uses the *median* instead of *mean*. Thus is *less sensitive to outliers*.

>[!hint]
>Although *k-median can be used with any [[distance function]]*, it is **usually paired with [[Manhattan distance]]**, because of its tendency to generate *diamond-shapes*
