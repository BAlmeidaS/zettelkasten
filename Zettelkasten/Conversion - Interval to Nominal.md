A conversion from [[interval variable]] to [[nominal variable]]

In such conversion the new [[categorical variable]] we *don't care about the order*

A *interval variable* that has an order such $\displaystyle \large A > B > C > D > E$
We can change to a *nominal variable* replacing:
- C to normal
- B and D to deviant
- A and E to extreme
