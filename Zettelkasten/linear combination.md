A *linear combination* involves multiplying [[vector|vectors]] by scalars, and adding these *scaled vectors* together creating a *new vector*.

If you have vectors $\displaystyle \large v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$, and some scalars like $\displaystyle \large a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, a possible linear combination is:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
a_1v_1+
a_2v_2+
\dots +
a_nv_n
\end{eqnarray}$$

This is by definition another vector spanned on the same space of $\displaystyle \large v1, \dots, v_n$
