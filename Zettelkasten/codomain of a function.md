*Codomain* is the *output set* of a [[function]], commonly denoted by $\displaystyle \large Y$

If $\displaystyle \large a$ is the input, $\displaystyle \large f(a)$ is the output, and it will be a unique $\displaystyle \large b$. Which means that $\displaystyle \large f(a)$ maps only to $\displaystyle \large b$ and nothing else.
