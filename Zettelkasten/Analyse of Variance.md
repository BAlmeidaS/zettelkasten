A [[Statistics]] technique that we use when *all the [[Explanatory variable|explanatory variables]] are [[Categorical variable|categorical]]*.

In this context, *explanatory variables are called **factors** and each factor has **two or more levels** (categories).

If we have:
- *1 Factor with 3 or more levels*: [[One-Way Anova]]
- *1 Factor with 2 levels*: [[Student's t test]] gives the same answer than [[Analyse of Variance|Anova]].
- *2 or more Factor*: [[Factorial Experiment]]

Models can also be compared using the function anova in `R` more details in [[Model Simplification - Model Complexity|model simplification]].
