The question behind comparing means of two samples is: *how likely is that our two sample means were drawn from populations with the same average?*

If it is high likely, then we can conclude that our two samples are not that different.

There are 2 simple tests to compare means:
- [[Student's t test]]
- [[Wilcoxon's test]]
