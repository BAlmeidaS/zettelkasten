The *standard deviation* is *a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values*.

It quantifies how much the values in a dataset differ from the [[Average|Mean]]. 

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

*standard deviation is the squared root of the [[variance]]*:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma &=& \sqrt{Variance}
\\
&=& 
\sqrt{
 \dfrac{\sum(y-\bar{y})^2}{n}
 }
\end{eqnarray}$$
