When you are *ranking* an array you are attributing one rank (order) for each value.

On ties, per default, *you get the average rank for each one of them and assign for all of them*:

1. if you have a tie on the 3, 4 elements of an array: each one of them will be defined as $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{3+4}{2} = 3.5$

2. If you have a tie with more elements, like, 5 equal elements on the positions:  4, 5, 6. Each one will have the rank $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{4+5+6}{3} = 5$
