Also known as, the **corrected sum of products, xy**,  it comes from [[Correct sums]]. Using [[The famous five from linear models]].
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
SSXY &=& \sum xy - \dfrac{(\sum x)(\sum y)}{n} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

*SSXY* is based on the [[Expected Value|Expectation]] of the product $\displaystyle \large (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})$
