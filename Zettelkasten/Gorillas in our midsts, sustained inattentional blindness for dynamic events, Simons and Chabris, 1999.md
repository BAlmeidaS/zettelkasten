This paper explains **inattentional blindness** - when we are so focused in something that we miss the obvious

Is a seminal work in the field of psychology. It highlights the phenomenon of inattentional blindness, where individuals fail to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight because their attention is engaged on another task, event, or object.

This study is famously known for an experiment where participants were asked to watch a video of people passing basketballs and count the number of passes made by players wearing white shirts. During the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene, stops to face the camera and thumps their chest, and then walks off the screen. Despite the obviousness of the gorilla, about half of the participants did not notice it because their attention was focused on the task of counting passes.

The findings from this study have had a wide-ranging impact on our understanding of human perception and attention. It demonstrates that people can be oblivious to significant events in their visual field if they are not the focus of their attention, suggesting limitations in human perceptual processing and raising important considerations for design, safety, and many other fields.
