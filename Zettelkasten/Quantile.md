*Quantiles* are values that split sorted data or a probability distribution into equal parts. Very useful in [[Statistics]]

Usually, $\displaystyle \large Quantile \in [0,1]$ 

$\displaystyle \large 0.233\ quantile$ is the data point that divide the data into $\displaystyle \large 23.3\%$ and $\displaystyle \large 76.7\%$
