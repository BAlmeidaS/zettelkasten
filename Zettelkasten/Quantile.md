*Quantiles* are values that split sorted data or a probability distribution into equal parts. Very useful in [[Statistics]]

Usually, $\displaystyle \large Quantile \in [0,1]$ 

$\displaystyle \large 0.233\ quantile$ is the data point that divide the data into $\displaystyle \large 23.3\%$ and $\displaystyle \large 76.7\%$

Measuring *quantiles* is typically a concept applied to [[continuous function|continuous]] or [[ordinal variable|ordinal]] data, where you can order the data and divide it into segments that reflect the distribution. 

Quantiles represent points in your data below which a certain percentage falls. This is straightforward with numerical data but can be complex and less meaningful with categorical data
