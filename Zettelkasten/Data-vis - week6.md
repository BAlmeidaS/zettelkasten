Definition of what is a **dashboard**:
- Originated as a control panel in vehicles and evolved in UI design for displaying key metrics in an easily understandable format
- Defined by Stephen Few as a visual display of critical information needed to achieve objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen for at-a-glance monitoring.
- Not intended for detailed data exploration but for maintaining situational awareness.
- Visual emphasis on graphics, access to a collection of KPIs, visibility within a single screen, and quick identification of important information.

*common mistakes in dashboard design*:
- Exceeding screen boundaries
- inadequate data context
- Excessive detail or precision
- Expressing measure indirectly
- introducing meaningless variety
- Arranging information poorly

**Remember data ink ratio**!

Definition of what is a *infographic*:
- Defined as graphic visual representations of information designed to present complex information quickly and clearly.
- Types include maps, timelines, comparison charts, etc.
- Good infographics are functional, multi-layered, and both beautiful and true to the data.

The lecturer said that for the coursework we can define a dashboard or an infographic, it is ok! See lecture recorded 43:30 - *Tableau dashboard is not necessarily a dashboard*
