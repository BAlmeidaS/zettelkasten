*Variance*, on the contrary of [[Sum of squares]], it is not super affected by the addition of a new data point. Also it is deeply connected with [[Degrees of Freedom]]:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
variance &=& \dfrac{sum\_of\_squares}{degrees\_of\_freedom} \\ \\
variance &=& s^2 = \dfrac{\sum(y-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}
\end{eqnarray}$$

*Why $\displaystyle \large n-1$ and not $\displaystyle \large n$?*
