*Spanning Tree* is a *connected subgraph in an **undirected graph** where **all vertices** are connected with the **minimum number of edges***.

In other words:
a **spanning tree _T_** of an **undirected graph** _G_ is a subgraph that is a [[Google - Review - Trees|Tree]] which includes **all of the vertices of _G_**. It uses only edges from the original graph.

### Minimum Spanning Tree

Given a *Weighted Undirected Graph*, we can define as *Minimum Spanning Tree* [[Minimum Spanning Tree|MST]], a *spanning tree* with the **minimum possible total edge weight**. It might exist more than one MST:
