This paper proposes a conformal prediction method tailored for graph-structured data. The proposed correction method is topology-aware and based on an empirical observation that inefficiencies correlate highly with network edges. The method updates node predictions based on its neighbors, and it is trainable alongside the GNN model. They also show how regular conformal prediction methods work under
