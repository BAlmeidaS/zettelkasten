**Correlation does not imply causation**

Correlation is when two [[Numerical variables|continuous variables]], $\displaystyle \large x$ and $\displaystyle \large y$, are correlated with each other.

It is defined in terms of the [[Variance]] of $\displaystyle \large x$, the [[Variance]] of $\displaystyle \large y$, and the [[Covariance]] of $\displaystyle \large x$ and $\displaystyle \large y$.

Correlation is defined, *the [[Covariance]] divided by the [[Geometric Mean]] of $\displaystyle \large x$ and $\displaystyle \large y$:
$$\displaystyle \Huge r = \dfrac{cov(x, y)}{\sqrt{s_x^2s_y^2}}$$

Using the [[Correct sums]] ([[SSXY]], [[SSX]], [[SSY]]) and the [[Covariance]] definition, $\displaystyle \large r$ can be defined also as:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
r &=& \dfrac{\text{SSXY}}{\sqrt{\text{SSX}*\text{SSY}}} \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
