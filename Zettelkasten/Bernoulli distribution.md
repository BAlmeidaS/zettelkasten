The [[Random Variable]] is either 0 or 1, with a sample size of 1 ($\displaystyle \large n = 1$). Aka *binomial distribution*.

Can be defined as the following probability function:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
P(x) &=& p^x(1-p)^{1-y} \\ \\
& &\text{* $p$ is the probability of success}
\end{eqnarray}$$
- [[Average|Mean]] = $\displaystyle \large p$
- [[Variance]] = $\displaystyle \large p(1-p)$
