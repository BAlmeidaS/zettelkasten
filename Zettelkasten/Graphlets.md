For instance, considering a graph of 3 nodes, [[Connected Graph|connected]], and considering the *node of interest*, there are only *three* possibilities, $\displaystyle \large G_1$, $\displaystyle \large G_2$ (based on node $\displaystyle \large 1$), and $\displaystyle \large G_2$ (based on node $\displaystyle \large 2$).
