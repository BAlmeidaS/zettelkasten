- state
- action
- goal test
- path cost / action cost function

We have a initial state, and a solution is a path to the goal state. Each step we run a goal test to check if the algorithm finished. From each state there are several action that can be taken and they will lead to other states.  

A performance can be measured in four ways:
- [[Completeness]]
- [[Cost optimality]]
- [[Time complexity]]
- [[Space complexity]]
