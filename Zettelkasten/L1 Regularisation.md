*L1 regularization* is also known as *lasso*, that stands for Least Absolute and Selection Operator.

Basically, it add a penalty on the [[loss function]] equal to the *absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients*.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\text{Loss} &=& \text{Pure loss}

\end{eqnarray}$$
