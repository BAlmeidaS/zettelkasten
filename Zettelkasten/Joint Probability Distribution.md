Notation for distribution of multiple variables

$$\Huge P(X_1, X_2, ...)$$
$\large X_i$ stands for a [[Random Variable]]. So each possible combination of the possible events on $\large X_1$, $\large X_2$, ... is a [[Proposition]]

If it is *discrete* is produces, the joint probability is a table:

If it is *continuous*, the joint probability is a probability function
