This paper considers the problem of evaluating online GNNs, specifically tackling the issue of train-test distribution shift. The contributions of the paper revolve around solving this problem specifically by taking into account real-world constraints, such as inability to access the train graph at test time.

The reviews said that the paper narrow down too much, although also agreed that it was a justified decision.
