Encoding in *GA* is the way to represent the chromosome. This is important because based on this decision there will be some [[Genetic Operators]] to be chosen.

The main types of encodings are:
- [[Binary Encoding]]
- [[Symbolic Encoding]]
- [[Real-value Encoding]]
- [[Heterogeneous Encoding]]
- [[Tree Encoding]]
