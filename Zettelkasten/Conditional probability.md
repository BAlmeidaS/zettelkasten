Conditional probability, define a [[Posterior]] as:

$$\Huge P(a \mid b) = \dfrac{P(a\land b)}{P(b)}$$

Basically, the probability of $\large a$ happens given $\large b$ is the probability of $\large a$ and $\large b$ happen normalised by the probability of $\large b$ happens.

Another way to see the same equation is [[product rule of probability]]
