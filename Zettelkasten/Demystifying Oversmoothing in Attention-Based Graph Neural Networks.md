The paper shows that contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. Reviewers have noted the paper's great writing and the well-elaborated and innovative concepts and techniques it presents. The findings in the paper have substantial implications for advancing the understanding of GNNs and offer instructive and valuable insights into research on oversmoothing.
