An *ordinal variable* is a [[Categorical variable]] that *has a clear, defined order of the categories*, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily consistent or known. 

- The categories can be ranked or ordered in a meaningful way.
- The differences between the categories cannot be measured or are not consistent.

e.g.: socioeconomic status, educational level.
