An *ordinal variable* is a [[Categorical variable]] that *has a clear, defined **order** or **ranking** of the categories*, but the intervals between the categories (the distance) are not necessarily consistent or known. 

- The categories can be ranked or ordered in a meaningful way.
- The differences between the categories are not necessarily equal.

>Socioeconomic status: $\displaystyle \large \{low, middle, high\}$
