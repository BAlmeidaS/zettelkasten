For [[Directed Graphs]] the generalisation of [[Connected Graph|Graph connectivity]] is divided into:

#### Strong Connected Directed Graphs
There is a [[path on a graph|Path]] from each node to every other node and vice-versa.

#### Weakly Connected Directed Graphs
The graph is a [[Connected Graph]] only if we *not consider the direction of the edges*
