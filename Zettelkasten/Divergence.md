*Divergence* is an operator which takes in the [[vector field]] $\displaystyle \large \mathbb{R}^n$ **and the output is a number** $\displaystyle \large \mathbb{R}$ measuring *the change in density of the fluid at a point*.

*Divergence* is the [[dot product]] of [[Vector nabla|nabla]]([[partial derivatives]]) and the [[vector field]] $\displaystyle \large \vec{v}$:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
div\ \vec{v} &=& \nabla \cdot\vec{v} \\
&=&
\dfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial x} +
\dfrac{\partial v_j}{\partial y} + \cdots
\end{eqnarray}$$

*divergence and dot-product start with C*
