*Mean Squared Deviation* is used for describing the variability or spread of a set of data points around their [[Average|Mean]]. 

It's a [[measure of dispersion]].

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
MSD = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i - \bar{x})^2
\end{eqnarray}$$

Being, $\displaystyle \large N$ the number of data points, $\displaystyle \large \bar{x}$ the [[Average|Mean]].
