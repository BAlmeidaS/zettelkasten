The *data-driven* reasoning.

The reasoning starts from the known data and proceeds forward with that data.

*In a forward chaining process, the system continues applying rules until it reaches a predefined goal or can no longer make further inferences based on the available facts.*

It is a technique for gathering information and then inferring from it whatever can be inferred. However, many rules may be executed that have nothing to do with the established goal.
