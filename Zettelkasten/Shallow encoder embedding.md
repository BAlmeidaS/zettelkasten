This type of [[Node Embeddings|encoder]] defines a *lookup matrix*, with size $\displaystyle \large (\text{number of nodes} \times dim(embedding))$.

So basically each [[Vertices|Node]] *represented as columns* will have an specific [[embedding]] *represented as rows*.

what [[Node Embeddings|encode decode approach]] will do is finding these cells parameters.
