A set of [[vector|vectors]] $\displaystyle \large v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$ are *linearly independent* if there is a solution for the equation:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
a_1v_1 +
a_2v_2 +
\dots +
a_kv_k = 0
\end{eqnarray}$$

different than $\displaystyle \large a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_k = 0$

On the other hand, if the only solution if with all $\displaystyle \large a_k = 0$ , they are **linearly dependent** and either, one (or more) vector is zero or a *linear combination of the others* (It can be defined as a combination of the others).
