This paper introduces an all-pair message passing scheme based on a kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator to reduce the complexity of message passing from quadratic (in number of nodes N) to linear time at the cost of some approximation error. The authors provide an analysis of the incurred error and present empirical comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
