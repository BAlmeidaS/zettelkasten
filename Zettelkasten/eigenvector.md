*eigenvector* are [[vector|vectors]] that *after a [[linear transformation]] don't change their direction*, the lingo is "the span is the same". Thus, they can be used as the *characteristic* property of the *transformation*.

Each *eigenvector* has associated an [[eigenvalue]].

So, an *eigenvector* $\displaystyle \large \vec{v}$ is the one that points to the same direction after the transformation $\displaystyle \large A$, only scaling it by its [[eigenvalue]] $\displaystyle \large \lambda$:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
A\vec{v} &=& \lambda\vec{v}\\
\end{eqnarray}$$

A transformation can ha
