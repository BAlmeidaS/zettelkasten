Related to [[Probability Density Function]], the *density* refers to the y-value for a given x-value in the distribution's graph. It represents the relative likelihood of the random variable falling near that x-value, *but it is not a probability itself*.

The key thing to remember is that for continuous probability distributions like the normal distribution, the probability of observing any exact value is technically zero because there are infinitely many points where the random variable could potentially fall.

The density gives us a way to compare how likely different outcomes are relative to each other, not to calculate exact probabilities directly. The actual probability for continuous random variables is always calculated over an interval, which corresponds to the area under the curve of the PDF over that interval.
