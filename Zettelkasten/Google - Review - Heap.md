Heap can be max or min!

### focusing all min because python is like this
- building a max heap using a min is just inverting the values

The top of a *min heap* is always the **smallest value**

# Insert
Always insert in the next empty spot, top to bottom, left to right

after inserting, it *bubbles data up* until it keeps the properties of the heap (smallest value is on top)
*In this example a 3 was added in the first space available and bubbled up*:
