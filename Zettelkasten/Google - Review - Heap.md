Heap can be max or min!

### focusing all min because python is like this
- building a max heap using a min is just inverting the values

The top of a *min heap* is always the **smallest value**

# insert
Always insert in the next empty spot, top to bottom, left to right

after inserting, and then *bubble it up* until it keeps the properties of the heap (smallest value is on top):
