Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which involve identifying useful connections between unconnected nodes on the original graph, while learning effective node representation on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion.

They define GT and use only with GCN (Convolution Graphs).

They say in the conclusion, that might be a good idea to combine GT with other types of layers rather than only GCN.
