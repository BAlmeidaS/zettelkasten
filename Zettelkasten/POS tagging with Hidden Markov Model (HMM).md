[[Hidden Markov Model]] for [[Part-of-speech tagging]].

In this sense HMM is used as a generative model, given some start it decides what words should follow to keep consistency on the [[Part-of-speech tagging]]. *It does not look to the meaning only to the structure.*

The biggest weakness is that everything we know about the language must be expressed in terms of *transition and sensor models*.
