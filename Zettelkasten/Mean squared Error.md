*MSE* is very much used in machine learning. It represents the [[average]] of the squares of the errors - that is, the difference between the actual values and the predicted values by a model.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
MSE = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
\end{eqnarray}$$

Being, $\displaystyle \large N$ the number of data points, *$\displaystyle \large y_i$ the actual values*, *$\displaystyle \large \hat{y_i}$ the predicted values by a model.
