*Classical/Crisp rules* from [[Rule-based system - Expert system]] are defined like:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
IF & & \text{speed is 80mph} \\
THEN & & \text{stopping\_distance is 315ft}
\end{eqnarray}$$

*Fuzzy rules* work with *fuzzy* inputs and outputs:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
IF & & \text{speed is fast} \\
THEN & & \text{stopping\_distance is long}
\end{eqnarray}$$
