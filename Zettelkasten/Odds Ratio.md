The *odds ratio* ($\displaystyle \large OR$) is a comparison of the *[[odds]] of an event occurring in two different groups*.

It's calculated as the ratio of the odds in one group to the odds in another group.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
OR &=& \dfrac{Odds(Y=1\mid X=a)}{Odds(Y=1\mid X=b)} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

The *OR* is particularly *used to compare the likelihood of a particular outcome across different groups* or under different conditions.

- $\displaystyle \large OR = 1$: The event we are interested in is *equally* likely when $\displaystyle \large X = a$ and when $\displaystyle \large X=b$. 
- $\displaystyle \large OR \gt 1$: The event we are interested in is *more equally* likely when $\displaystyle \large X = a$. 
- $\displaystyle \large OR \lt 1$: The event we are interested in is *less equally* likely when $\displaystyle \large X = a$. 

As in [[Log Odds]] it is common to apply *log* to *odds ratio* and create **log odds ratio**.

For instance,

consider two groups, A and B. If the odds of an event in Group A are 2 (meaning the event is twice as likely to occur as not) and in Group B are 4 (meaning the event is four times as likely to occur as not), the odds ratio is $\displaystyle \large \dfrac{4}{2} = 2$

This means that the odds of the event happening in Group B are twice as high as in Group A.
