It is defined as the *reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocals*. Reciprocal is "one over".

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\widetilde{y} &=& \dfrac{1}{mean(\tfrac{1}{y})} \\ \\

\widetilde{y} &=& \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{\sum\tfrac{1}{y}}{n}} \\ \\

\widetilde{y} &=& \dfrac{n}{\sum\tfrac{1}{y}} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

*The harmonic mean will always be the least among the mean, median, and mode. **

It's particularly useful in situations where you are averaging ratios or rates, like speed or density. For example, if you want to calculate the average speed of a trip where different legs of the trip are traveled at different speeds, the harmonic mean would give you the correct average speed.
