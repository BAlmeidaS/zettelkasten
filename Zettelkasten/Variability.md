A measure of *variability* is one of the most important quantities from [[Statistics]].

The greater the variability, the bigger will be our uncertainty in the values and the lower will be our ability to distinguish between hypotheses.

There are a bunch of variability metrics: [[Range]], [[Deviation]], [[Sum of squares errors]], [[Variance]],  [[mean squared deviation]]
