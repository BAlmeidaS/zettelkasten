An *array* is a data structure in computer science that consists of a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access and manipulation of the elements using their indices.

A *sequence* is just a more *general concept*, because sequences might have different types of objects inside.
