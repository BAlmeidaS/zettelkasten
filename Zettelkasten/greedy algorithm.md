The principle behind a greedy algorithm is to make the *locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum*. 

In other words, at each step, the algorithm picks the best immediate, or "greedy," choice without considering the bigger picture, hoping that these local optima will lead to a global optimum solution.

An example would be [[Greedy Best-first search]]
