  - Hyperparameters
---
- Are settings or configurations that are *set before the training process* begins.
- They are *not learned* from the data *but are chosen* by the designer of the model
- Controls various aspects of the training process, such as the model's architecture, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, regularization strength, etc.
- The goal is to find the best set of hyperparameters that results in a model that generalises well to unseen data.
