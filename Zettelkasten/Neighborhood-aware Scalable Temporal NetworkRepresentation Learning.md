The paper proposes Neighborhood-Aware Temporal network model (NAT) for temporal network representation learning for link prediction tasks. The authors design a dictionary-type neighborhood representation and dedicated data structure N-cache (for fast parallel computing) to record down-sampled set of the neighboring nodes to construct structural features for a joint neighborhood of multiple nodes. The final representation is a combination of structural features and aggregated representations of common neighbors. Extensive experiment results and ablation studies are provided to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.
