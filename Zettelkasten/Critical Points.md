In [[multivariable function]], the *critical points* are the points where the [[gradient]] is zero.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \vec{0}
\end{eqnarray}$$
This means that all the [[partial derivatives]] must be $\displaystyle \large 0$, or the [[tangent plane]] must be flat.

This may be because they are:
- [[local minima]]
- [[local maxima]]
- [[saddle points]]

To decide by them, you must use the [[second-partial derivative test]]
