In [[Statistics]], *Parametric* methods assume that the underlying *data follows a certain distribution*, most commonly the normal distribution. 

This assumption allows for the use of specific statistical tests that have greater power due to the additional structure provided by the model. 

*The term "parametric" comes from the fact that the distribution can be described using a finite number of parameters*.
