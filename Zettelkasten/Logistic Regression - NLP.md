[[Logistic Regression]] when used on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] is a [[Discriminative model]].

It learns a [[Conditional probability]] $\displaystyle \large \boldsymbol{P}(C\mid W)$, meaning that it can assign categories given a sequence of words, but it *cannot generate random sentences*
