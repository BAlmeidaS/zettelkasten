Regarding [[Hypothesis Test]] and `R`, the alternative that you insert on the test is related to [[Null Hypothesis|H0]] and [[Alternative Hypothesis|H1]].

`alternative = "greater"`:
- H0: $\displaystyle \large x_1 = x_2$
- H1: $\displaystyle \large x_1 \gt x_2$

`alternative = "two.sided"`:
- H0: $\displaystyle \large x_1 = x_2$
- H1: $\displaystyle \large x_1 \ne x_2$
