*Overfitting* in [[Machine Learning]] refers to a model that is too closely fit to the particularities of the training data, including noise and outliers, and fails to generalise well to new, unseen data

The overfit model has *low generalisation power* due to *high complexity* and *noise learning*.

Ways to prevent:
- Collect more data
- [[Regularisation]]
