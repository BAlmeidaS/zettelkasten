In this paper, the authors considered the dynamic graph representation learning (a.k.a. dynamic network embedding) problem and proposed a novel transformer-based architecture - DyGFormer, with several original designs (e.g., a neighbor co-occurrence encoding scheme, a patching technique, etc.) Moreover, the authors also implemented a unified continuous-time dynamic graph learning library, which include several baselines, widely-used datasets, and a common evaluation pipeline. Exhaustive experiments with various settings of dynamic link prediction and dynamic node classification were also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
