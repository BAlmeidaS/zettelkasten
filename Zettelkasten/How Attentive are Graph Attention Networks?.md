This paper argues that the widely adopted graph attention networks (GAT) have a shortcoming that with the static nature of the attention mechanism, they may fail to represent certain graphs. This paper presents an alternative, GATv2, a simple variant with the same time complexity as GAT but with more expressivity, able to represent the graphs that GAT fails to. This is shown both empirically and theoretically, with various tasks on synthetic as well as standard benchmark graphs. 

GATs are of high interest to the ICLR community, and this paper makes fundamental progress in how attention works in GNNs. This is one of the few papers that present both empirical and theoretical analyses, and these findings will motivate others in the community to make further advances in this field.
