[[Random Variable]]s are independents when the result of an event from one has no connection with the other

Formal definition of  $\displaystyle \large X$ being independent of $\displaystyle \large Y$
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
&P&(X\mid Y) = P(X) \\
&\text{or}& \\
&P&(X, Y) = P(X \land Y) = P(X)*P(Y) \\
\end{eqnarray}$$
