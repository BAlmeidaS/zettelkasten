*Complex numbers* or *Complexes* are defined as $\displaystyle \large \mathbb{C}$

It is the set of all *complex numbers*
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\mathbb{C} &=& \{a+bi\mid a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}
\end{eqnarray}$$

**complex numbers** allow solution to **all** [[polynomial|polynomial equations]], even those that have no solution in the [[Real numbers]].
