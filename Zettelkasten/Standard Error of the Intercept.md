The [[Standard Errors - Measure of Unreliability|Standard error]] of the *intercepet* on [[Regression Analysis|Linear Model]] is defined as:
$$\displaystyle \Huge SE_{intercept} = \sqrt{\dfrac{s^2\sum x_i^2}{SSX*n}}$$
*[[Variance|s-squared]] and [[SSX]](the spread of the x values along the x-axis)*

The farther from the y-axis the mean is the bigger will be the $\displaystyle \large SE_{intercept}$

Note that, this is just a *special case* for $\displaystyle \large x = 0$ of the [[Standard Error for a predicted y in linear regression]].
