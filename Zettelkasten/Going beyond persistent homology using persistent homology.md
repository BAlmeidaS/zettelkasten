The authors introduce RePHINE, which calculates 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) with respect to the filtration on edge colors, augmented with so-called missing holes and vertex color information. They establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing graphs. RePHINE is shown to be more expressive than both standard 0-dim and 1-dim PH, can be easily integrated into GNNs, and is demonstrated to boost their expressive power on several benchmarks for graph classification.
