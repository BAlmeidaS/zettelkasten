In datavis we want to:
- *Minimizing chart-junk*. *Chart-junk* is visual content that distracts from the core message.
- *Maximising data-ink*: *data-ink* is the non-redudant ink arranged in the graph (_Tufte_)

*Reduce non-data pixels*:

- avoid overloading
- summarise where possible
- *most important info on top-left*

- don't apply different representation to express the same relationship
- don't use different colour schemes to show same values/categories
- All visualisation is visible at once!

**focus and context dilemma**: zoom out to see the overview and zoom in to see details
- *difficult to compare* and *easy to get lost* 
- Attention divided between two views, so, *memory burden*
- So, try to *balance focus and context*.

Summary:
- Minimising Chart-Junk and Maximising Data-Ink
- Consistency Across Multiple Views
- Overview Plus Detail and Distortion Views - techniques like bifocal views and fisheye suppression (_Generalized fisheye views, george furnas, 1986_) distortion to manage the focus and context problem
- fisheye suppression for prioritizing information based on its degree of interest
- Use of animation to group data points and support view transformations
