*Boosting* is a type of [[Ensemble method]]. 

In boosting, models are trained sequentially, each trying to correct the errors made by the previous models.

The predictions are then combined through a weighted sum to produce the final prediction.

Examples of boosting algorithms include [[Gradient Boosting]], and [[XGBoost]].
