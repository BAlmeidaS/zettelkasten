*Scalability* is a [[non-functional requirements|non-functional requirement]].

>***The property of a system to handle a growing load*** (requests per second, volume of incoming or outgoing data, concurrent connections)

- [[Vertical Scaling]]
- [[Horizontal Scaling]]

 [[Elasticity]] is a common concept that is related to *scalability* but is not the same.

 ***Scalability** is about **provision resources** in incremental manner over longer time intervals*.

*Scalability is about **long-term**, strategic needs*.

Important to notice that scalability might be made *manually* or *automatically*.
