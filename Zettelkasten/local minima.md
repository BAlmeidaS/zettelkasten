In [[multivariable function]], there might be many points that can be considered *local minima* (*minima* is plural of *minimum*).

All the *red-arrows* point to *local minima*,
but only the one circled in *green* is also the *global minimum*.

To be a *local minima* a point must be a [[Critical Points|critical point]] and lay down in a specific case of the [[second-partial derivative test]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\nabla_f(\boldsymbol{x_0}) &=& \vec{0}
\\
D(\boldsymbol{x_0}) &>& 0
\\
f_{xx}(\boldsymbol{x_0}) &>& 0 
\ (\text{or }
f_{yy}(\boldsymbol{x_0}) > 0)
\end{eqnarray}$$
