Odds should *NOT* be confused with *probability*.

*Odds are the ration of something happening to something not happen*

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
odds &=& \dfrac{\text{probability of winning}}{\text{probability of losing}} \\ \\
odds &=& \dfrac{p}{1-p}
\end{eqnarray}$$

being $\displaystyle \large p$ the probability of success and $\displaystyle \large 1-p$ the probability of failure.

On the contrary of probability, which goes from 0 to 1, *odds go from 0 to infinity*.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
odds &=& 1 \\

\end{eqnarray}$$
