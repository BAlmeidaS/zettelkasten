Given that the [[Jacobian matrix]] is the linear transformation around each point of the [[domain of a function|domain]]. It is worth to notice that it will be only possible to calculate if the [[Jacobian matrix]] is squared, in other words, if the [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain of a function]]

Its [[Determinant]] is basically *how much a transformation stretches or squishes the space*

>[!example]
>$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
>f(x, y) &=&
>\begin{bmatrix}  
>xy \\ sin(x+y) \\ x^2-y^2
>\end{bmatrix}
>\\\\
>J(f(x,y)) &=&
>\begin{bmatrix}  
>y & x \\
>cos(x+y) & cos (x+y) \\
>2x & -2y
>\end{bmatrix} \\
>\end{eqnarray}$$
