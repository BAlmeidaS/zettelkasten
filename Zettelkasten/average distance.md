A type of [[distance function]]. 

*Average distance* was defined to minimise the fact that [[euclidean distance]] might have a smaller distance between two data points that don't have no attributes in common in comparison with other two that may have.

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 

d_{euclidean}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) &=&
\sqrt{
\dfrac{1}{n}
\sum^{n}_{i=0} (x_i - y_i)^2
} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$
