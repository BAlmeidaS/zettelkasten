A [[Vertices|vertice]] is important if it lies on many shortests [[path on a graph|paths]] between other nodes

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
c_v = \sum_{s\ne v \ne t}\dfrac
{\#(\text{shortest paths between s and t that contains v})}
{\#(\text{shortest paths between s and t})}
\end{eqnarray}$$
*a node is as important as is important as a "transit hub" for the other nodes*
