The paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction" introduces STAR, a framework that uses attention mechanisms to predict pedestrian trajectories by modeling complex spatio-temporal interactions. STAR comprises a spatial Transformer, which captures crowd interactions via a novel TGConv mechanism, and a temporal Transformer, which handles temporal dependencies. Additionally, it employs an external memory module to ensure temporal consistency. STAR outperforms state-of-the-art models on five real-world pedestrian datasets by effectively interleaving spatial and temporal attention layers, demonstrating superior accuracy in predicting pedestrian movements in various crowded environments.
