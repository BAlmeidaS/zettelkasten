death first search has more details here: [[Depth-first search|DFS]]

What matters here is that it might be defined using a [[Google - Review - Stacks and Queues|stack]]. This stack might be created explicitly, or might be the call stack in the memory, using [[Recursion|recursion]].

Besides, we need a *set* as well, to record the *seen* nodes, avoiding repetition.

*There are **3 ways** to traverse using DFS*:
- [[preorder traversal]]
- [[inorder traversal]]
- [[postorder traversal]]
