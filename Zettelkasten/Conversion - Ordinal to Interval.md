A conversion from a [[ordinal variable]] to an [[interval variable]].

The problem here is that we must *assign a score to each class that preservers the rank order and exhibits magnitude difference among classes*.

Some methods are:
1. Use the class ranks - Consider that they are equally distant
2. Leverage existing scales - Using an external scale as reference
3. Maximise [[Correlation]] with the new interval with another [[interval variable]] reference.
4. [[Factor Analysis]]
