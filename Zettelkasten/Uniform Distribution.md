*Uniform distribution* is a type of [[Probability Distributions]] that all points are equally likely.

In a *continuous* form, the [[Probability Density Function|PDF]] between two bounds $\displaystyle \large a$ and $\displaystyle \large b$ is:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
p(x) = \dfrac{1}{a-b}, \text{ for } a\le x \le b
\end{eqnarray}$$

In a discrete form, each of $\displaystyle \large n$ possible outcomes have:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
p(x) = \dfrac{1}{n}
\end{eqnarray}$$
