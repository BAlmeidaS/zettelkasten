The *log odds* is basically the log of the [[Odds]]:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
\log(\text{odds of a var}) = \log\dfrac{p}{1 - p}
\end{eqnarray}$$
being $\displaystyle \large p$ the probability of that variable to be true

The idea to *apply log* over odds is **to make it symmetrical around 0**, instead of going from 0 to $\displaystyle \large \infty$, it goes from $\displaystyle \large -\infty$ to $\displaystyle \large \infty$.

*Positive log odds* -> **higher chances to win**
*Negative log odds* -> **higher chances to lose**
