The *log odds* is basically the log of the [[Odds]].

The idea to *apply log* over odds is *to make it symmetrical around 0*, instead of going from 0 to $\displaystyle \large \infty$, it goes from $\displaystyle \large -\infty$ to $\displaystyle \large \infty$.

*Positive log odds* -> **higher chances to win**
*Negative log odds* -> **higher chances to lose**
