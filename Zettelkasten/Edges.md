*Edges* are the connections between [[Vertices]] in a [[Graphs|Graph]]. They represent the relationships between the entities.

Usually they are defined as a set of order pairs $\displaystyle \large E$ :
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
E &=& \{(v_1, v_7), (v_3, v_2), \dots\} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$
