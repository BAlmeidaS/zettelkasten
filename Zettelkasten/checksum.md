*Checksum* is a value derived from a file (or data block) using a **hash function** or a similar algorithm. It serves as a unique identifier for that data and is used to detect errors, corruption, or unintended modifications.

### Key Points:

- A checksum helps detect **data corruption** due to transmission errors, storage issues, or malware.
- It is not cryptographically secure (except for cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256).
- It is commonly used in **file integrity verification** to increase [[Durability]] of a system.
