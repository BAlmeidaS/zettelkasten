In this strategy, the dataset is divided into two parts, *one for training the model and the other for testing its performance*.

The split can be [[random sampling]] or [[stratified random sampling]].

It provides a basic way to prevent [[overfitting]] by ensuring that the *model is tested on unseen data* (test set).

The *problem* is that you can *end up overfitting your models in the test set*.
