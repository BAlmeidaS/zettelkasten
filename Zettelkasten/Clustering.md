The definition of *clustering* is finding groups of [[instance|examples]] that are **very similar with each other, and objects in different groups are quite distinct**. This groups are called [[cluster]].

Clustering is *based on* [[distance]]. Through distance we can measure this (dis)similarities

There are two types of clustering:
- [[hard clustering]]
- [[fuzzy clustering]]
