The definition of *clustering* is finding groups of [[instance|examples]] that are **very similar with each other, and objects in different groups are quite distinct**. This groups are called [[cluster]].

Clustering is *based on* [[distance]]. Through distance we can measure this (dis)similarities

Clustering can be understood as a function that maps a datapoint to an output:
$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray} 
f:x\rightarrow cluster
\end{eqnarray}$$

There are two types of clustering:
- [[hard clustering]]
	- [[Partitional clustering]]
	- [[Hierarchical clustering]]
- [[fuzzy clustering]]
