Also called **uncoditional**

In a [[Joint Probability Distribution]] with many random variables, the probability of an event $\displaystyle \large \omega$ from a [[Random Variable]] $\displaystyle \large X_1$ happened, regardless the other random variables:

$$\displaystyle \Huge \begin{eqnarray}
&P(\omega)&,\ \omega \in X_1 \\
\\
&P(\omega)& = 
P(\omega\mid X_{2,1}) +
P(\omega\mid X_{2,2}) +
\dots +
P(\omega\mid X_{3,1}) +
\dots
\end{eqnarray}$$

This process is called **marginalisation** or **summing out**
