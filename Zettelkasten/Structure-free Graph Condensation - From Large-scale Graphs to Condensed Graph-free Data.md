This paper presents a new method to condense a training graph into a smaller number of disconnected nodes, such that a GNN trained on these nodes performs similar to one trained on the original graph at test time.

This paper studies an interesting problem. The authors proposes a new paradigm for reducing the size of large-scale graphs without explicit graph structures. The proposed SFGC, encodes topology structure information into node attributes in synthesized graph-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compred with existing graph condensation methods.
