This paper explores the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial attacks. Drawing inspiration from principles in physics, the authors propose a novel model called Hamiltonian Neural Flows for constructing GNN models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on various benchmark datasets.
