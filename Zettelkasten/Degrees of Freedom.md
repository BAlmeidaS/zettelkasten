*degree of freedom* is the sample size, $\displaystyle \large n$, minus the number of parameters, $\displaystyle \large p$, estimated from the data.

Degrees of freedom typically refer to the *number of independent values* which can be assigned to a statistical distribution. In a practical sense, the degrees of freedom $\displaystyle \large \text{d.f.}$ are a measure of the amount of information available to estimate another piece of necessary information.

This concept is used in several contexts in [[Statistics]]

For instance,

In a case that we have *11 data points* and we estimate only *1 parameter* from the data, the *mean*, we have $\displaystyle \large n-1 = 10\ \text{d.f.}$ 

This means that 10 from the 11 data points can vary with total freedom, but as soon as we defined 10 of them, the 11th must be one specific in order to have the mean that we calculated.
