In [[Regression Analysis|Linear Regression]] the best model is the one with *the minimum sum of squared errors* [[Sum of squares|SSE]] 

Defining [[Deviation|Residual]] of a point $\displaystyle \large i$ as $\displaystyle \large d_i$, we want the $\displaystyle \large min(\sum d_i)$.
$$\displaystyle \Huge \sum d^2 = \sum (y - a - bx) ^ 2$$

Using the [[Correct sums]] we can define:
- **explained variation**, SSR
