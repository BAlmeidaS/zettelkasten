aka *Ancova*, It is a combination of [[Regression Analysis]] and [[Analyse of Variance]].

The [[Response variable|dependent variable]] *is continuous* and there is *at least one [[Continuous variable]] and one [[Categorical variable]] among the [[Explanatory variable|independent variables]]*.

In *Ancova* we need to do [[Model Simplification - Model Complexity]]!

In *Ancova*, typically, *the data are non-orthogonal - **So the order of the parameters matter!***

It is basically a [[Regression Analysis|Linear Model]] that combine categorical and numerical data. *For each category (or combination of categories, if you have more than one categorical variable) Ancova will define a linear regression using the numerical variables*

In *blue* we have one ANCOVA model, having different linear regressions depending on the category (grazed or ungrazed)
