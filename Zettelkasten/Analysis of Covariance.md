aka *Ancova*, It is a combination of [[Regression Analysis]] and [[Analyse of Variance]].

The [[Response variable|dependent variable]] *is continuous* and there is *at least one [[Continuous variable]] and one [[Categorical variable]] among the [[Explanatory variable|independent variables]]*.

In *Ancova* we need to do [[model simplification]]!

In *Ancova*, typically, *the data are non-orthogonal - **So the order of the parameters matter!***
