The paper presents a computational method called GEARS (graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator). GEARS integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene-gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It can predict outcomes for both single and multigene perturbations, even for gene combinations not previously experimentally perturbed. GEARS demonstrates higher precision and effectiveness than existing methods in identifying genetic interactions and predicting phenotypic outcomes of perturbations, making it a valuable tool for designing perturbational experiments and advancing biomedical research.
