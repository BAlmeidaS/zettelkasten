# Chapter 3 - Solving problems by searching

- Divides [[search problem]]s into two types: [[Uninformed Search]] and [[Informed Search]]
- Uninformed search
	- [[Best-first search]]
	- [[Breadth-first search]]
	- [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] ([[Uniform-cost search]])
	- [[Depth-first search]]
	- [[Iterative-deepening search]]
	- [[Bidirectional search]]
- Informed search - Heuristic search
	- [[Greedy Best-first search]]
	- [[A* search]]
	- [[Recursive best-first search]] ([[RBFS]])
- [[Memory-bound searches]]
- Heuristic performance:
	- [[Admissible]] and [[Consistent]]
	- Generating heuristic from [[Relaxed problems]]
	- [[Effective branching factor]]
