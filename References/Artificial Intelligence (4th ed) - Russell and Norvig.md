# Chapter 3 - Solving problems by searching

- Divides [[Search problem]]s into two types: [[Uninformed Search]] and [[Informed Search]]
- [[Best-first search]]
- Uninformed search
	- [[Breadth-first search - BFS]]
	- [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] ([[Uniform-Cost search]])
	- [[Depth-first search - DFS]]
	- [[Iterative-deepening search]]
	- [[Bidirectional search]]
- Informed search - Heuristic search
	- [[Greedy Best-first search]]
	- [[A* search]]
	- [[Weighted A* search]]
- [[Memory-bound searches]]
	- [[Recursive best-first search - RBFS]]
	- A bidirectional heuristic search is described but I decided to not add
- [[Good heuristics in search space]]:
	- [[Admissible Heuristic]] and [[Consistent Heuristic]]
	- Generating heuristic from [[Relaxed problems]]
	- [[Effective branching factor]]
